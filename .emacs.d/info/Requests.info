'Requests' is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for
human beings.

__________________________________________________________________

'Behold, the power of Requests':

     >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
     >>> r.status_code
     200
     >>> r.headers['content-type']
     'application/json; charset=utf8'
     >>> r.encoding
     'utf-8'
     >>> r.text
     '{"type":"User"...'
     >>> r.json()
     {'private_gists': 419, 'total_private_repos': 77, ...}

See similar code, sans Requests(1).

'Requests' allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to
form-encode your POST data.  Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are
100% automatic, thanks to urllib3(2).

2.1.2 Get the Source Code
-------------------------

Requests is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is always
available(1).

You can either clone the public repository:

     $ git clone https://github.com/psf/requests.git

Or, download the tarball(2):

     $ curl -OL https://github.com/psf/requests/tarball/main
     # optionally, zipball is also available (for Windows users).

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python
package, or install it into your site-packages easily:

     $ cd requests
     $ python -m pip install .

2.2 Quickstart
==============

Eager to get started?  This page gives a good introduction in how to get
started with Requests.

First, make sure that:

   * Requests is *note installed: 4.

   * Requests is *note up-to-date: f.

Let’s get started with some simple examples.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Make a Request,  Next: Passing Parameters In URLs,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.1 Make a Request
--------------------

Making a request with Requests is very simple.

Begin by importing the Requests module:

     >>> import requests

Now, let’s try to get a webpage.  For this example, let’s get GitHub’s
public timeline:

     >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')

Now, we have a *note Response: 11. object called ‘r’.  We can get all
the information we need from this object.

Requests’ simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as
obvious.  For example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request:

     >>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data={'key': 'value'})

Nice, right?  What about the other HTTP request types: PUT, DELETE, HEAD
and OPTIONS? These are all just as simple:

     >>> r = requests.put('https://httpbin.org/put', data={'key': 'value'})
     >>> r = requests.delete('https://httpbin.org/delete')
     >>> r = requests.head('https://httpbin.org/get')
     >>> r = requests.options('https://httpbin.org/get')

That’s all well and good, but it’s also only the start of what Requests
can do.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Passing Parameters In URLs,  Next: Response Content,  Prev: Make a Request,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.2 Passing Parameters In URLs
--------------------------------

You often want to send some sort of data in the URL’s query string.  If
you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as
key/value pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g.
‘httpbin.org/get?key=val’.  Requests allows you to provide these
arguments as a dictionary of strings, using the ‘params’ keyword
argument.  As an example, if you wanted to pass ‘key1=value1’ and
‘key2=value2’ to ‘httpbin.org/get’, you would use the following code:

     >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
     >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)

You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL:

     >>> print(r.url)
     https://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1

Note that any dictionary key whose value is ‘None’ will not be added to
the URL’s query string.

You can also pass a list of items as a value:

     >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': ['value2', 'value3']}

     >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)
     >>> print(r.url)
     https://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2&key2=value3


File: Requests.info,  Node: Response Content,  Next: Binary Response Content,  Prev: Passing Parameters In URLs,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.3 Response Content
----------------------

We can read the content of the server’s response.  Consider the GitHub
timeline again:

     >>> import requests

     >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
     >>> r.text
     '[{"repository":{"open_issues":0,"url":"https://github.com/...

Requests will automatically decode content from the server.  Most
unicode charsets are seamlessly decoded.

When you make a request, Requests makes educated guesses about the
encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers.  The text encoding
guessed by Requests is used when you access ‘r.text’.  You can find out
what encoding Requests is using, and change it, using the ‘r.encoding’
property:

     >>> r.encoding
     'utf-8'
     >>> r.encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'

If you change the encoding, Requests will use the new value of
‘r.encoding’ whenever you call ‘r.text’.  You might want to do this in
any situation where you can apply special logic to work out what the
encoding of the content will be.  For example, HTML and XML have the
ability to specify their encoding in their body.  In situations like
this, you should use ‘r.content’ to find the encoding, and then set
‘r.encoding’.  This will let you use ‘r.text’ with the correct encoding.

Requests will also use custom encodings in the event that you need them.
If you have created your own encoding and registered it with the
‘codecs’ module, you can simply use the codec name as the value of
‘r.encoding’ and Requests will handle the decoding for you.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Binary Response Content,  Next: JSON Response Content,  Prev: Response Content,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.4 Binary Response Content
-----------------------------

You can also access the response body as bytes, for non-text requests:

     >>> r.content
     b'[{"repository":{"open_issues":0,"url":"https://github.com/...

The ‘gzip’ and ‘deflate’ transfer-encodings are automatically decoded
for you.

The ‘br’ transfer-encoding is automatically decoded for you if a Brotli
library like brotli(1) or brotlicffi(2) is installed.

For example, to create an image from binary data returned by a request,
you can use the following code:

     >>> from PIL import Image
     >>> from io import BytesIO

     >>> i = Image.open(BytesIO(r.content))

File: Requests.info,  Node: JSON Response Content,  Next: Raw Response Content,  Prev: Binary Response Content,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.5 JSON Response Content
---------------------------

There’s also a builtin JSON decoder, in case you’re dealing with JSON
data:

     >>> import requests

     >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
     >>> r.json()
     [{'repository': {'open_issues': 0, 'url': 'https://github.com/...

In case the JSON decoding fails, ‘r.json()’ raises an exception.  For
example, if the response gets a 204 (No Content), or if the response
contains invalid JSON, attempting ‘r.json()’ raises
‘requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError’.  This wrapper exception provides
interoperability for multiple exceptions that may be thrown by different
python versions and json serialization libraries.

It should be noted that the success of the call to ‘r.json()’ does 'not'
indicate the success of the response.  Some servers may return a JSON
object in a failed response (e.g.  error details with HTTP 500).  Such
JSON will be decoded and returned.  To check that a request is
successful, use ‘r.raise_for_status()’ or check ‘r.status_code’ is what
you expect.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Raw Response Content,  Next: Custom Headers,  Prev: JSON Response Content,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.6 Raw Response Content
--------------------------

In the rare case that you’d like to get the raw socket response from the
server, you can access ‘r.raw’.  If you want to do this, make sure you
set ‘stream=True’ in your initial request.  Once you do, you can do
this:

     >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events', stream=True)

     >>> r.raw
     <urllib3.response.HTTPResponse object at 0x101194810>

     >>> r.raw.read(10)
     b'\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x03'

In general, however, you should use a pattern like this to save what is
being streamed to a file:

     with open(filename, 'wb') as fd:
         for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=128):
             fd.write(chunk)

Using ‘Response.iter_content’ will handle a lot of what you would
otherwise have to handle when using ‘Response.raw’ directly.  When
streaming a download, the above is the preferred and recommended way to
retrieve the content.  Note that ‘chunk_size’ can be freely adjusted to
a number that may better fit your use cases.

     Note: An important note about using ‘Response.iter_content’ versus
     ‘Response.raw’.  ‘Response.iter_content’ will automatically decode
     the ‘gzip’ and ‘deflate’ transfer-encodings.  ‘Response.raw’ is a
     raw stream of bytes – it does not transform the response content.
     If you really need access to the bytes as they were returned, use
     ‘Response.raw’.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Custom Headers,  Next: More complicated POST requests,  Prev: Raw Response Content,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.7 Custom Headers
--------------------

If you’d like to add HTTP headers to a request, simply pass in a ‘dict’
to the ‘headers’ parameter.

For example, we didn’t specify our user-agent in the previous example:

     >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
     >>> headers = {'user-agent': 'my-app/0.0.1'}

     >>> r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

Note: Custom headers are given less precedence than more specific
sources of information.  For instance:

   * Authorization headers set with ‘headers=’ will be overridden if
     credentials are specified in ‘.netrc’, which in turn will be
     overridden by the ‘auth=’ parameter.  Requests will search for the
     netrc file at ‘~/.netrc’, ‘~/_netrc’, or at the path specified by
     the ‘NETRC’ environment variable.  Check details in *note netrc
     authentication: 19.

   * Authorization headers will be removed if you get redirected
     off-host.

   * Proxy-Authorization headers will be overridden by proxy credentials
     provided in the URL.

   * Content-Length headers will be overridden when we can determine the
     length of the content.

Furthermore, Requests does not change its behavior at all based on which
custom headers are specified.  The headers are simply passed on into the
final request.

Note: All header values must be a ‘string’, bytestring, or unicode.
While permitted, it’s advised to avoid passing unicode header values.


File: Requests.info,  Node: More complicated POST requests,  Next: POST a Multipart-Encoded File,  Prev: Custom Headers,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.8 More complicated POST requests
------------------------------------

Typically, you want to send some form-encoded data — much like an HTML
form.  To do this, simply pass a dictionary to the ‘data’ argument.
Your dictionary of data will automatically be form-encoded when the
request is made:

     >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

     >>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
     >>> print(r.text)
     {
       ...
       "form": {
         "key2": "value2",
         "key1": "value1"
       },
       ...
     }

The ‘data’ argument can also have multiple values for each key.  This
can be done by making ‘data’ either a list of tuples or a dictionary
with lists as values.  This is particularly useful when the form has
multiple elements that use the same key:

     >>> payload_tuples = [('key1', 'value1'), ('key1', 'value2')]
     >>> r1 = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload_tuples)
     >>> payload_dict = {'key1': ['value1', 'value2']}
     >>> r2 = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload_dict)
     >>> print(r1.text)
     {
       ...
       "form": {
         "key1": [
           "value1",
           "value2"
         ]
       },
       ...
     }
     >>> r1.text == r2.text
     True

There are times that you may want to send data that is not form-encoded.
If you pass in a ‘string’ instead of a ‘dict’, that data will be posted
directly.

For example, the GitHub API v3 accepts JSON-Encoded POST/PATCH data:

     >>> import json

     >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
     >>> payload = {'some': 'data'}

     >>> r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload))

Please note that the above code will NOT add the ‘Content-Type’ header
(so in particular it will NOT set it to ‘application/json’).

If you need that header set and you don’t want to encode the ‘dict’
yourself, you can also pass it directly using the ‘json’ parameter
(added in version 2.4.2) and it will be encoded automatically:

     >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
     >>> payload = {'some': 'data'}

     >>> r = requests.post(url, json=payload)

Note, the ‘json’ parameter is ignored if either ‘data’ or ‘files’ is
passed.


File: Requests.info,  Node: POST a Multipart-Encoded File,  Next: Response Status Codes,  Prev: More complicated POST requests,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.9 POST a Multipart-Encoded File
-----------------------------------

Requests makes it simple to upload Multipart-encoded files:

     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
     >>> files = {'file': open('report.xls', 'rb')}

     >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
     >>> r.text
     {
       ...
       "files": {
         "file": "<censored...binary...data>"
       },
       ...
     }

You can set the filename, content_type and headers explicitly:

     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
     >>> files = {'file': ('report.xls', open('report.xls', 'rb'), 'application/vnd.ms-excel', {'Expires': '0'})}

     >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
     >>> r.text
     {
       ...
       "files": {
         "file": "<censored...binary...data>"
       },
       ...
     }

If you want, you can send strings to be received as files:

     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
     >>> files = {'file': ('report.csv', 'some,data,to,send\nanother,row,to,send\n')}

     >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
     >>> r.text
     {
       ...
       "files": {
         "file": "some,data,to,send\\nanother,row,to,send\\n"
       },
       ...
     }

In the event you are posting a very large file as a
‘multipart/form-data’ request, you may want to stream the request.  By
default, ‘requests’ does not support this, but there is a separate
package which does - ‘requests-toolbelt’.  You should read the
toolbelt's documentation(1) for more details about how to use it.

For sending multiple files in one request refer to the *note advanced:
1c. section.

     Warning: It is strongly recommended that you open files in binary
     mode(2).  This is because Requests may attempt to provide the
     ‘Content-Length’ header for you, and if it does this value will be
     set to the number of 'bytes' in the file.  Errors may occur if you
     open the file in 'text mode'.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Response Status Codes,  Next: Response Headers,  Prev: POST a Multipart-Encoded File,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.10 Response Status Codes
----------------------------

We can check the response status code:

     >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
     >>> r.status_code
     200

Requests also comes with a built-in status code lookup object for easy
reference:

     >>> r.status_code == requests.codes.ok
     True

If we made a bad request (a 4XX client error or 5XX server error
response), we can raise it with *note Response.raise_for_status(): 1e.:

     >>> bad_r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/404')
     >>> bad_r.status_code
     404

     >>> bad_r.raise_for_status()
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "requests/models.py", line 832, in raise_for_status
         raise http_error
     requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 404 Client Error

But, since our ‘status_code’ for ‘r’ was ‘200’, when we call
‘raise_for_status()’ we get:

     >>> r.raise_for_status()
     None

All is well.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Response Headers,  Next: Cookies,  Prev: Response Status Codes,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.11 Response Headers
-----------------------

We can view the server’s response headers using a Python dictionary:

     >>> r.headers
     {
         'content-encoding': 'gzip',
         'transfer-encoding': 'chunked',
         'connection': 'close',
         'server': 'nginx/1.0.4',
         'x-runtime': '148ms',
         'etag': '"e1ca502697e5c9317743dc078f67693f"',
         'content-type': 'application/json'
     }

The dictionary is special, though: it’s made just for HTTP headers.
According to RFC 7230(1), HTTP Header names are case-insensitive.

So, we can access the headers using any capitalization we want:

     >>> r.headers['Content-Type']
     'application/json'

     >>> r.headers.get('content-type')
     'application/json'

It is also special in that the server could have sent the same header
multiple times with different values, but requests combines them so they
can be represented in the dictionary within a single mapping, as per RFC
7230(2):

     A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field
     name into one “field-name: field-value” pair, without changing the
     semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field value
     to the combined field value in order, separated by a comma.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Cookies,  Next: Redirection and History,  Prev: Response Headers,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.12 Cookies
--------------

If a response contains some Cookies, you can quickly access them:

     >>> url = 'http://example.com/some/cookie/setting/url'
     >>> r = requests.get(url)

     >>> r.cookies['example_cookie_name']
     'example_cookie_value'

To send your own cookies to the server, you can use the ‘cookies’
parameter:

     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies'
     >>> cookies = dict(cookies_are='working')

     >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
     >>> r.text
     '{"cookies": {"cookies_are": "working"}}'

Cookies are returned in a *note RequestsCookieJar: 21, which acts like a
‘dict’ but also offers a more complete interface, suitable for use over
multiple domains or paths.  Cookie jars can also be passed in to
requests:

     >>> jar = requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar()
     >>> jar.set('tasty_cookie', 'yum', domain='httpbin.org', path='/cookies')
     >>> jar.set('gross_cookie', 'blech', domain='httpbin.org', path='/elsewhere')
     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies'
     >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=jar)
     >>> r.text
     '{"cookies": {"tasty_cookie": "yum"}}'


File: Requests.info,  Node: Redirection and History,  Next: Timeouts,  Prev: Cookies,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.13 Redirection and History
------------------------------

By default Requests will perform location redirection for all verbs
except HEAD.

We can use the ‘history’ property of the Response object to track
redirection.

The *note Response.history: 23. list contains the *note Response: 11.
objects that were created in order to complete the request.  The list is
sorted from the oldest to the most recent response.

For example, GitHub redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS:

     >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com/')

     >>> r.url
     'https://github.com/'

     >>> r.status_code
     200

     >>> r.history
     [<Response [301]>]

If you’re using GET, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE, you can
disable redirection handling with the ‘allow_redirects’ parameter:

     >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)

     >>> r.status_code
     301

     >>> r.history
     []

If you’re using HEAD, you can enable redirection as well:

     >>> r = requests.head('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=True)

     >>> r.url
     'https://github.com/'

2.2.14 Timeouts
---------------

You can tell Requests to stop waiting for a response after a given
number of seconds with the ‘timeout’ parameter.  Nearly all production
code should use this parameter in nearly all requests.  Failure to do so
can cause your program to hang indefinitely:

     >>> requests.get('https://github.com/', timeout=0.001)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     requests.exceptions.Timeout: HTTPConnectionPool(host='github.com', port=80): Request timed out. (timeout=0.001)

     Note: ‘timeout’ is not a time limit on the entire response
     download; rather, an exception is raised if the server has not
     issued a response for ‘timeout’ seconds (more precisely, if no
     bytes have been received on the underlying socket for ‘timeout’
     seconds).  If no timeout is specified explicitly, requests do not
     time out.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Errors and Exceptions,  Prev: Timeouts,  Up: Quickstart

2.2.15 Errors and Exceptions
----------------------------

In the event of a network problem (e.g.  DNS failure, refused
connection, etc), Requests will raise a *note ConnectionError: 26.
exception.

*note Response.raise_for_status(): 1e. will raise an *note HTTPError:
27. if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.

If a request times out, a *note Timeout: 28. exception is raised.

If a request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections, a
*note TooManyRedirects: 29. exception is raised.

All exceptions that Requests explicitly raises inherit from *note
requests.exceptions.RequestException: 2a.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Session Objects,  Next: Request and Response Objects,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.1 Session Objects
---------------------

The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across
requests.  It also persists cookies across all requests made from the
Session instance, and will use ‘urllib3’’s connection pooling(1).  So if
you’re making several requests to the same host, the underlying TCP
connection will be reused, which can result in a significant performance
increase (see HTTP persistent connection(2)).

A Session object has all the methods of the main Requests API.

Let’s persist some cookies across requests:

     s = requests.Session()

     s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')
     r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies')

     print(r.text)
     # '{"cookies": {"sessioncookie": "123456789"}}'

Sessions can also be used to provide default data to the request
methods.  This is done by providing data to the properties on a Session
object:

     s = requests.Session()
     s.auth = ('user', 'pass')
     s.headers.update({'x-test': 'true'})

     # both 'x-test' and 'x-test2' are sent
     s.get('https://httpbin.org/headers', headers={'x-test2': 'true'})

Any dictionaries that you pass to a request method will be merged with
the session-level values that are set.  The method-level parameters
override session parameters.

Note, however, that method-level parameters will 'not' be persisted
across requests, even if using a session.  This example will only send
the cookies with the first request, but not the second:

     s = requests.Session()

     r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies={'from-my': 'browser'})
     print(r.text)
     # '{"cookies": {"from-my": "browser"}}'

     r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies')
     print(r.text)
     # '{"cookies": {}}'

If you want to manually add cookies to your session, use the *note
Cookie utility functions: 2f. to manipulate *note Session.cookies: 30.

Sessions can also be used as context managers:

     with requests.Session() as s:
         s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')

This will make sure the session is closed as soon as the ‘with’ block is
exited, even if unhandled exceptions occurred.

     Remove a Value From a Dict Parameter: Sometimes you’ll want to omit
     session-level keys from a dict parameter.  To do this, you simply
     set that key’s value to ‘None’ in the method-level parameter.  It
     will automatically be omitted.

All values that are contained within a session are directly available to
you.  See the *note Session API Docs: 31. to learn more.

2.3.2 Request and Response Objects
----------------------------------

Whenever a call is made to ‘requests.get()’ and friends, you are doing
two major things.  First, you are constructing a ‘Request’ object which
will be sent off to a server to request or query some resource.  Second,
a ‘Response’ object is generated once Requests gets a response back from
the server.  The ‘Response’ object contains all of the information
returned by the server and also contains the ‘Request’ object you
created originally.  Here is a simple request to get some very important
information from Wikipedia’s servers:

     >>> r = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python')

If we want to access the headers the server sent back to us, we do this:

     >>> r.headers
     {'content-length': '56170', 'x-content-type-options': 'nosniff', 'x-cache':
     'HIT from cp1006.eqiad.wmnet, MISS from cp1010.eqiad.wmnet', 'content-encoding':
     'gzip', 'age': '3080', 'content-language': 'en', 'vary': 'Accept-Encoding,Cookie',
     'server': 'Apache', 'last-modified': 'Wed, 13 Jun 2012 01:33:50 GMT',
     'connection': 'close', 'cache-control': 'private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0,
     must-revalidate', 'date': 'Thu, 14 Jun 2012 12:59:39 GMT', 'content-type':
     'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'x-cache-lookup': 'HIT from cp1006.eqiad.wmnet:3128,
     MISS from cp1010.eqiad.wmnet:80'}

However, if we want to get the headers we sent the server, we simply
access the request, and then the request’s headers:

     >>> r.request.headers
     {'Accept-Encoding': 'identity, deflate, compress, gzip',
     'Accept': '*/*', 'User-Agent': 'python-requests/1.2.0'}


File: Requests.info,  Node: Prepared Requests,  Next: SSL Cert Verification,  Prev: Request and Response Objects,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.3 Prepared Requests
-----------------------

Whenever you receive a *note Response: 11. object from an API call or a
Session call, the ‘request’ attribute is actually the ‘PreparedRequest’
that was used.  In some cases you may wish to do some extra work to the
body or headers (or anything else really) before sending a request.  The
simple recipe for this is the following:

     from requests import Request, Session

     s = Session()

     req = Request('POST', url, data=data, headers=headers)
     prepped = req.prepare()

     # do something with prepped.body
     prepped.body = 'No, I want exactly this as the body.'

     # do something with prepped.headers
     del prepped.headers['Content-Type']

     resp = s.send(prepped,
         stream=stream,
         verify=verify,
         proxies=proxies,
         cert=cert,
         timeout=timeout
     )

     print(resp.status_code)

Since you are not doing anything special with the ‘Request’ object, you
prepare it immediately and modify the ‘PreparedRequest’ object.  You
then send that with the other parameters you would have sent to
‘requests.*’ or ‘Session.*’.

However, the above code will lose some of the advantages of having a
Requests *note Session: 36. object.  In particular, *note Session:
36.-level state such as cookies will not get applied to your request.
To get a *note PreparedRequest: 37. with that state applied, replace the
call to *note Request.prepare(): 38. with a call to *note
Session.prepare_request(): 39, like this:

     from requests import Request, Session

     s = Session()
     req = Request('GET',  url, data=data, headers=headers)

     prepped = s.prepare_request(req)

     # do something with prepped.body
     prepped.body = 'Seriously, send exactly these bytes.'

     # do something with prepped.headers
     prepped.headers['Keep-Dead'] = 'parrot'

     resp = s.send(prepped,
         stream=stream,
         verify=verify,
         proxies=proxies,
         cert=cert,
         timeout=timeout
     )

     print(resp.status_code)

When you are using the prepared request flow, keep in mind that it does
not take into account the environment.  This can cause problems if you
are using environment variables to change the behaviour of requests.
For example: Self-signed SSL certificates specified in
‘REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE’ will not be taken into account.  As a result an
‘SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED’ is thrown.  You can get around this
behaviour by explicitly merging the environment settings into your
session:

     from requests import Request, Session

     s = Session()
     req = Request('GET', url)

     prepped = s.prepare_request(req)

     # Merge environment settings into session
     settings = s.merge_environment_settings(prepped.url, {}, None, None, None)
     resp = s.send(prepped, **settings)

     print(resp.status_code)


File: Requests.info,  Node: SSL Cert Verification,  Next: Client Side Certificates,  Prev: Prepared Requests,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.4 SSL Cert Verification
---------------------------

Requests verifies SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web
browser.  By default, SSL verification is enabled, and Requests will
throw a SSLError if it’s unable to verify the certificate:

     >>> requests.get('https://requestb.in')
     requests.exceptions.SSLError: hostname 'requestb.in' doesn't match either of '*.herokuapp.com', 'herokuapp.com'

I don’t have SSL setup on this domain, so it throws an exception.
Excellent.  GitHub does though:

     >>> requests.get('https://github.com')
     <Response [200]>

You can pass ‘verify’ the path to a CA_BUNDLE file or directory with
certificates of trusted CAs:

     >>> requests.get('https://github.com', verify='/path/to/certfile')

or persistent:

     s = requests.Session()
     s.verify = '/path/to/certfile'

     Note: If ‘verify’ is set to a path to a directory, the directory
     must have been processed using the ‘c_rehash’ utility supplied with
     OpenSSL.

This list of trusted CAs can also be specified through the
‘REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE’ environment variable.  If ‘REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE’ is
not set, ‘CURL_CA_BUNDLE’ will be used as fallback.

Requests can also ignore verifying the SSL certificate if you set
‘verify’ to False:

     >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org', verify=False)
     <Response [200]>

Note that when ‘verify’ is set to ‘False’, requests will accept any TLS
certificate presented by the server, and will ignore hostname mismatches
and/or expired certificates, which will make your application vulnerable
to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  Setting verify to ‘False’ may be
useful during local development or testing.

By default, ‘verify’ is set to True.  Option ‘verify’ only applies to
host certs.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Client Side Certificates,  Next: CA Certificates,  Prev: SSL Cert Verification,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.5 Client Side Certificates
------------------------------

You can also specify a local cert to use as client side certificate, as
a single file (containing the private key and the certificate) or as a
tuple of both files’ paths:

     >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org', cert=('/path/client.cert', '/path/client.key'))
     <Response [200]>

or persistent:

     s = requests.Session()
     s.cert = '/path/client.cert'

If you specify a wrong path or an invalid cert, you’ll get a SSLError:

     >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org', cert='/wrong_path/client.pem')
     SSLError: [Errno 336265225] _ssl.c:347: error:140B0009:SSL routines:SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file:PEM lib

     Warning: The private key to your local certificate 'must' be
     unencrypted.  Currently, Requests does not support using encrypted
     keys.


File: Requests.info,  Node: CA Certificates,  Next: Body Content Workflow,  Prev: Client Side Certificates,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.6 CA Certificates
---------------------

Requests uses certificates from the package certifi(1).  This allows for
users to update their trusted certificates without changing the version
of Requests.

Before version 2.16, Requests bundled a set of root CAs that it trusted,
sourced from the Mozilla trust store(2).  The certificates were only
updated once for each Requests version.  When ‘certifi’ was not
installed, this led to extremely out-of-date certificate bundles when
using significantly older versions of Requests.

For the sake of security we recommend upgrading certifi frequently!

File: Requests.info,  Node: Body Content Workflow,  Next: Keep-Alive,  Prev: CA Certificates,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.7 Body Content Workflow
---------------------------

By default, when you make a request, the body of the response is
downloaded immediately.  You can override this behaviour and defer
downloading the response body until you access the *note
Response.content: 41. attribute with the ‘stream’ parameter:

     tarball_url = 'https://github.com/psf/requests/tarball/main'
     r = requests.get(tarball_url, stream=True)

At this point only the response headers have been downloaded and the
connection remains open, hence allowing us to make content retrieval
conditional:

     if int(r.headers['content-length']) < TOO_LONG:
       content = r.content
       ...

You can further control the workflow by use of the *note
Response.iter_content(): 42. and *note Response.iter_lines(): 43.
methods.  Alternatively, you can read the undecoded body from the
underlying urllib3 urllib3.HTTPResponse(1) at *note Response.raw: 44.

If you set ‘stream’ to ‘True’ when making a request, Requests cannot
release the connection back to the pool unless you consume all the data
or call *note Response.close: 45.  This can lead to inefficiency with
connections.  If you find yourself partially reading request bodies (or
not reading them at all) while using ‘stream=True’, you should make the
request within a ‘with’ statement to ensure it’s always closed:

     with requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', stream=True) as r:
         # Do things with the response here.

2.3.8 Keep-Alive
----------------

Excellent news — thanks to urllib3, keep-alive is 100% automatic within
a session!  Any requests that you make within a session will
automatically reuse the appropriate connection!

Note that connections are only released back to the pool for reuse once
all body data has been read; be sure to either set ‘stream’ to ‘False’
or read the ‘content’ property of the ‘Response’ object.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Streaming Uploads,  Next: Chunk-Encoded Requests,  Prev: Keep-Alive,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.9 Streaming Uploads
-----------------------

Requests supports streaming uploads, which allow you to send large
streams or files without reading them into memory.  To stream and
upload, simply provide a file-like object for your body:

     with open('massive-body', 'rb') as f:
         requests.post('http://some.url/streamed', data=f)

     Warning: It is strongly recommended that you open files in binary
     mode(1).  This is because Requests may attempt to provide the
     ‘Content-Length’ header for you, and if it does this value will be
     set to the number of 'bytes' in the file.  Errors may occur if you
     open the file in 'text mode'.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Chunk-Encoded Requests,  Next: POST Multiple Multipart-Encoded Files,  Prev: Streaming Uploads,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.10 Chunk-Encoded Requests
-----------------------------

Requests also supports Chunked transfer encoding for outgoing and
incoming requests.  To send a chunk-encoded request, simply provide a
generator (or any iterator without a length) for your body:

     def gen():
         yield 'hi'
         yield 'there'

     requests.post('http://some.url/chunked', data=gen())

For chunked encoded responses, it’s best to iterate over the data using
*note Response.iter_content(): 42.  In an ideal situation you’ll have
set ‘stream=True’ on the request, in which case you can iterate
chunk-by-chunk by calling ‘iter_content’ with a ‘chunk_size’ parameter
of ‘None’.  If you want to set a maximum size of the chunk, you can set
a ‘chunk_size’ parameter to any integer.


File: Requests.info,  Node: POST Multiple Multipart-Encoded Files,  Next: Event Hooks,  Prev: Chunk-Encoded Requests,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.11 POST Multiple Multipart-Encoded Files
--------------------------------------------

You can send multiple files in one request.  For example, suppose you
want to upload image files to an HTML form with a multiple file field
‘images’:

     <input type="file" name="images" multiple="true" required="true"/>

To do that, just set files to a list of tuples of ‘(form_field_name,
file_info)’:

     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
     >>> multiple_files = [
     ...     ('images', ('foo.png', open('foo.png', 'rb'), 'image/png')),
     ...     ('images', ('bar.png', open('bar.png', 'rb'), 'image/png'))]
     >>> r = requests.post(url, files=multiple_files)
     >>> r.text
     {
       ...
       'files': {'images': 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw ....'}
       'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=3131623adb2043caaeb5538cc7aa0b3a',
       ...
     }

     Warning: It is strongly recommended that you open files in binary
     mode(1).  This is because Requests may attempt to provide the
     ‘Content-Length’ header for you, and if it does this value will be
     set to the number of 'bytes' in the file.  Errors may occur if you
     open the file in 'text mode'.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Event Hooks,  Next: Custom Authentication,  Prev: POST Multiple Multipart-Encoded Files,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.12 Event Hooks
------------------

Requests has a hook system that you can use to manipulate portions of
the request process, or signal event handling.

Available hooks:

‘response’:

     The response generated from a Request.

You can assign a hook function on a per-request basis by passing a
‘{hook_name: callback_function}’ dictionary to the ‘hooks’ request
parameter:

     hooks={'response': print_url}

That ‘callback_function’ will receive a chunk of data as its first
argument.

     def print_url(r, *args, **kwargs):
         print(r.url)

Your callback function must handle its own exceptions.  Any unhandled
exception won’t be passed silently and thus should be handled by the
code calling Requests.

If the callback function returns a value, it is assumed that it is to
replace the data that was passed in.  If the function doesn’t return
anything, nothing else is affected.

     def record_hook(r, *args, **kwargs):
         r.hook_called = True
         return r

Let’s print some request method arguments at runtime:

     >>> requests.get('https://httpbin.org/', hooks={'response': print_url})
     https://httpbin.org/
     <Response [200]>

You can add multiple hooks to a single request.  Let’s call two hooks at
once:

     >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/', hooks={'response': [print_url, record_hook]})
     >>> r.hook_called
     True

You can also add hooks to a ‘Session’ instance.  Any hooks you add will
then be called on every request made to the session.  For example:

     >>> s = requests.Session()
     >>> s.hooks['response'].append(print_url)
     >>> s.get('https://httpbin.org/')
      https://httpbin.org/
      <Response [200]>

A ‘Session’ can have multiple hooks, which will be called in the order
they are added.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Custom Authentication,  Next: Streaming Requests,  Prev: Event Hooks,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.13 Custom Authentication
----------------------------

Requests allows you to specify your own authentication mechanism.

Any callable which is passed as the ‘auth’ argument to a request method
will have the opportunity to modify the request before it is dispatched.

Authentication implementations are subclasses of *note AuthBase: 52, and
are easy to define.  Requests provides two common authentication scheme
implementations in ‘requests.auth’: *note HTTPBasicAuth: 53. and *note
HTTPDigestAuth: 54.

Let’s pretend that we have a web service that will only respond if the
‘X-Pizza’ header is set to a password value.  Unlikely, but just go with
it.

     from requests.auth import AuthBase

     class PizzaAuth(AuthBase):
         """Attaches HTTP Pizza Authentication to the given Request object."""
         def __init__(self, username):
             # setup any auth-related data here
             self.username = username

         def __call__(self, r):
             # modify and return the request
             r.headers['X-Pizza'] = self.username
             return r

Then, we can make a request using our Pizza Auth:

     >>> requests.get('http://pizzabin.org/admin', auth=PizzaAuth('kenneth'))
     <Response [200]>

2.3.14 Streaming Requests
-------------------------

With *note Response.iter_lines(): 43. you can easily iterate over
streaming APIs such as the Twitter Streaming API(1). Simply set ‘stream’
to ‘True’ and iterate over the response with *note iter_lines: 43.:

     import json
     import requests

     r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/stream/20', stream=True)

     for line in r.iter_lines():

         # filter out keep-alive new lines
         if line:
             decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')
             print(json.loads(decoded_line))

When using ‘decode_unicode=True’ with *note Response.iter_lines(): 43.
or *note Response.iter_content(): 42, you’ll want to provide a fallback
encoding in the event the server doesn’t provide one:

     r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/stream/20', stream=True)

     if r.encoding is None:
         r.encoding = 'utf-8'

     for line in r.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
         if line:
             print(json.loads(line))

     Warning: *note iter_lines: 43. is not reentrant safe.  Calling this
     method multiple times causes some of the received data being lost.
     In case you need to call it from multiple places, use the resulting
     iterator object instead:

          lines = r.iter_lines()
          # Save the first line for later or just skip it

          first_line = next(lines)

          for line in lines:
              print(line)

2.3.15 Proxies
--------------

If you need to use a proxy, you can configure individual requests with
the ‘proxies’ argument to any request method:

     import requests

     proxies = {
       'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
       'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
     }

     requests.get('http://example.org', proxies=proxies)

Alternatively you can configure it once for an entire *note Session:
36.:

     import requests

       'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
       'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
     }
     session = requests.Session()
     session.proxies.update(proxies)

     session.get('http://example.org')

     Warning: Setting ‘session.proxies’ may behave differently than
     expected.  Values provided will be overwritten by environmental
     proxies (those returned by urllib.request.getproxies(1)).  To
     ensure the use of proxies in the presence of environmental proxies,
     explicitly specify the ‘proxies’ argument on all individual
     requests as initially explained above.

     See #2018(2) for details.

When the proxies configuration is not overridden per request as shown
above, Requests relies on the proxy configuration defined by standard
environment variables ‘http_proxy’, ‘https_proxy’, ‘no_proxy’, and
‘all_proxy’.  Uppercase variants of these variables are also supported.
You can therefore set them to configure Requests (only set the ones
relevant to your needs):

     $ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
     $ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
     $ export ALL_PROXY="socks5://10.10.1.10:3434"

     $ python
     >>> import requests
     >>> requests.get('http://example.org')

To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, use the
‘http://user:password@host/’ syntax in any of the above configuration
entries:

     $ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:1080"

     $ python
     >>> proxies = {'http': 'http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/'}

     Warning: Storing sensitive username and password information in an
     environment variable or a version-controlled file is a security
     risk and is highly discouraged.

To give a proxy for a specific scheme and host, use the
‘scheme://hostname’ form for the key.  This will match for any request
to the given scheme and exact hostname.

     proxies = {'http://10.20.1.128': 'http://10.10.1.10:5323'}

Note that proxy URLs must include the scheme.

Finally, note that using a proxy for https connections typically
requires your local machine to trust the proxy’s root certificate.  By
default the list of certificates trusted by Requests can be found with:

     from requests.utils import DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE_PATH
     print(DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE_PATH)

You override this default certificate bundle by setting the
‘REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE’ (or ‘CURL_CA_BUNDLE’) environment variable to
another file path:

     $ export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE="/usr/local/myproxy_info/cacert.pem"
     $ export https_proxy="http://10.10.1.10:1080"

     $ python
     >>> import requests
     >>> requests.get('https://example.org')

2.3.15.1 SOCKS
..............

Added in version 2.10.0.

In addition to basic HTTP proxies, Requests also supports proxies using
the SOCKS protocol.  This is an optional feature that requires that
additional third-party libraries be installed before use.

You can get the dependencies for this feature from ‘pip’:

     $ python -m pip install 'requests[socks]'

Once you’ve installed those dependencies, using a SOCKS proxy is just as
easy as using a HTTP one:

     proxies = {
         'http': 'socks5://user:pass@host:port',
         'https': 'socks5://user:pass@host:port'
     }

Using the scheme ‘socks5’ causes the DNS resolution to happen on the
client, rather than on the proxy server.  This is in line with curl,
which uses the scheme to decide whether to do the DNS resolution on the
client or proxy.  If you want to resolve the domains on the proxy
server, use ‘socks5h’ as the scheme.

2.3.16 Compliance

Requests is intended to be compliant with all relevant specifications
and RFCs where that compliance will not cause difficulties for users.
This attention to the specification can lead to some behaviour that may
seem unusual to those not familiar with the relevant specification.

* Menu:

* Encodings::


File: Requests.info,  Node: Encodings,  Up: Compliance

2.3.16.1 Encodings
..................

When you receive a response, Requests makes a guess at the encoding to
use for decoding the response when you access the *note Response.text:
5e. attribute.  Requests will first check for an encoding in the HTTP
header, and if none is present, will use charset_normalizer(1) or
chardet(2) to attempt to guess the encoding.

If ‘chardet’ is installed, ‘requests’ uses it, however for python3
‘chardet’ is no longer a mandatory dependency.  The ‘chardet’ library is
an LGPL-licenced dependency and some users of requests cannot depend on
mandatory LGPL-licensed dependencies.

When you install ‘requests’ without specifying ‘[use_chardet_on_py3]’
extra, and ‘chardet’ is not already installed, ‘requests’ uses
‘charset-normalizer’ (MIT-licensed) to guess the encoding.

The only time Requests will not guess the encoding is if no explicit
charset is present in the HTTP headers 'and' the ‘Content-Type’ header
contains ‘text’.  In this situation, RFC 2616(3) specifies that the
default charset must be ‘ISO-8859-1’.  Requests follows the
specification in this case.  If you require a different encoding, you
can manually set the *note Response.encoding: 5f. property, or use the
raw *note Response.content: 41.

2.3.17 HTTP Verbs
-----------------

Requests provides access to almost the full range of HTTP verbs: GET,
OPTIONS, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. The following provides
detailed examples of using these various verbs in Requests, using the
GitHub API.

We will begin with the verb most commonly used: GET. HTTP GET is an
idempotent method that returns a resource from a given URL. As a result,
it is the verb you ought to use when attempting to retrieve data from a
web location.  An example usage would be attempting to get information
about a specific commit from GitHub.  Suppose we wanted commit ‘a050faf’
on Requests.  We would get it like so:

     >>> import requests
     >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/git/commits/a050faf084662f3a352dd1a941f2c7c9f886d4ad')

We should confirm that GitHub responded correctly.  If it has, we want
to work out what type of content it is.  Do this like so:

     >>> if r.status_code == requests.codes.ok:
     ...     print(r.headers['content-type'])
     ...
     application/json; charset=utf-8

So, GitHub returns JSON. That’s great, we can use the *note r.json: 62.
method to parse it into Python objects.

     >>> commit_data = r.json()

     >>> print(commit_data.keys())
     ['committer', 'author', 'url', 'tree', 'sha', 'parents', 'message']

     >>> print(commit_data['committer'])
     {'date': '2012-05-10T11:10:50-07:00', 'email': 'me@kennethreitz.com', 'name': 'Kenneth Reitz'}

     >>> print(commit_data['message'])
     makin' history

So far, so simple.  Well, let’s investigate the GitHub API a little bit.
Now, we could look at the documentation, but we might have a little more
fun if we use Requests instead.  We can take advantage of the Requests
OPTIONS verb to see what kinds of HTTP methods are supported on the url
we just used.

     >>> verbs = requests.options(r.url)
     >>> verbs.status_code
     500

Uh, what?  That’s unhelpful!  Turns out GitHub, like many API providers,
don’t actually implement the OPTIONS method.  This is an annoying
oversight, but it’s OK, we can just use the boring documentation.  If
GitHub had correctly implemented OPTIONS, however, they should return
the allowed methods in the headers, e.g.

     >>> verbs = requests.options('http://a-good-website.com/api/cats')
     >>> print(verbs.headers['allow'])
     GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS

Turning to the documentation, we see that the only other method allowed
for commits is POST, which creates a new commit.  As we’re using the
Requests repo, we should probably avoid making ham-handed POSTS to it.
Instead, let’s play with the Issues feature of GitHub.

This documentation was added in response to Issue #482(1).  Given that
this issue already exists, we will use it as an example.  Let’s start by
getting it.

     >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/482')
     >>> r.status_code
     200

     >>> issue = json.loads(r.text)

     >>> print(issue['title'])
     Feature any http verb in docs

     >>> print(issue['comments'])
     3

Cool, we have three comments.  Let’s take a look at the last of them.

     >>> r = requests.get(r.url + '/comments')
     >>> r.status_code
     200

     >>> comments = r.json()

     >>> print(comments[0].keys())
     ['body', 'url', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'user', 'id']

     >>> print(comments[2]['body'])
     Probably in the "advanced" section

Well, that seems like a silly place.  Let’s post a comment telling the
poster that he’s silly.  Who is the poster, anyway?

     >>> print(comments[2]['user']['login'])
     kennethreitz

OK, so let’s tell this Kenneth guy that we think this example should go
in the quickstart guide instead.  According to the GitHub API doc, the
way to do this is to POST to the thread.  Let’s do it.

     >>> body = json.dumps({u"body": u"Sounds great! I'll get right on it!"})
     >>> url = u"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/482/comments"

     >>> r = requests.post(url=url, data=body)
     >>> r.status_code
     404

Huh, that’s weird.  We probably need to authenticate.  That’ll be a
pain, right?  Wrong.  Requests makes it easy to use many forms of
authentication, including the very common Basic Auth.

     >>> from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
     >>> auth = HTTPBasicAuth('fake@example.com', 'not_a_real_password')

     >>> r = requests.post(url=url, data=body, auth=auth)
     >>> r.status_code
     201

     >>> content = r.json()
     >>> print(content['body'])
     Sounds great! I'll get right on it.

Brilliant.  Oh, wait, no!  I meant to add that it would take me a while,
because I had to go feed my cat.  If only I could edit this comment!
Happily, GitHub allows us to use another HTTP verb, PATCH, to edit this
comment.  Let’s do that.

     >>> print(content[u"id"])
     5804413

     >>> body = json.dumps({u"body": u"Sounds great! I'll get right on it once I feed my cat."})
     >>> url = u"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/comments/5804413"

     >>> r = requests.patch(url=url, data=body, auth=auth)
     >>> r.status_code
     200

Excellent.  Now, just to torture this Kenneth guy, I’ve decided to let
him sweat and not tell him that I’m working on this.  That means I want
to delete this comment.  GitHub lets us delete comments using the
incredibly aptly named DELETE method.  Let’s get rid of it.

     >>> r = requests.delete(url=url, auth=auth)
     >>> r.status_code
     204
     >>> r.headers['status']
     '204 No Content'

Excellent.  All gone.  The last thing I want to know is how much of my
ratelimit I’ve used.  Let’s find out.  GitHub sends that information in
the headers, so rather than download the whole page I’ll send a HEAD
request to get the headers.

     >>> r = requests.head(url=url, auth=auth)
     >>> print(r.headers)
     ...
     'x-ratelimit-remaining': '4995'
     'x-ratelimit-limit': '5000'
     ...

Excellent.  Time to write a Python program that abuses the GitHub API in
all kinds of exciting ways, 4995 more times.

2.3.18 Custom Verbs
-------------------

From time to time you may be working with a server that, for whatever
reason, allows use or even requires use of HTTP verbs not covered above.
One example of this would be the MKCOL method some WEBDAV servers use.
Do not fret, these can still be used with Requests.  These make use of
the built-in ‘.request’ method.  For example:

     >>> r = requests.request('MKCOL', url, data=data)
     >>> r.status_code
     200 # Assuming your call was correct

Utilising this, you can make use of any method verb that your server
allows.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Link Headers,  Next: Transport Adapters,  Prev: Custom Verbs,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.19 Link Headers
-------------------

Many HTTP APIs feature Link headers.  They make APIs more self
describing and discoverable.

GitHub uses these for pagination(1) in their API, for example:

     >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=1&per_page=10'
     >>> r = requests.head(url=url)
     >>> r.headers['link']
     '<https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=2&per_page=10>; rel="next", <https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=6&per_page=10>; rel="last"'

Requests will automatically parse these link headers and make them
easily consumable:

     >>> r.links["next"]
     {'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=2&per_page=10', 'rel': 'next'}

     >>> r.links["last"]
     {'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=7&per_page=10', 'rel': 'last'}

2.3.20 Transport Adapters
-------------------------

As of v1.0.0, Requests has moved to a modular internal design using
Transport Adapters.  These objects provide a mechanism to define
interaction methods for an HTTP service.  In particular, they allow you
to apply per-service configuration.

Requests ships with a single Transport Adapter, the *note HTTPAdapter:
69.  This adapter provides the default Requests interaction with HTTP
and HTTPS using the powerful urllib3(1) library.  Whenever a Requests
*note Session: 36. is initialized, one of these is attached to the *note
Session: 36. object for HTTP, and one for HTTPS.

Requests enables users to create and use their own Transport Adapters
that provide specific functionality.  Once created, a Transport Adapter
can be mounted to a Session object, along with an indication of which
web services it should apply to.

     >>> s = requests.Session()
     >>> s.mount('https://github.com/', MyAdapter())

The mount call registers a specific instance of a Transport Adapter to a
prefix.  Once mounted, any HTTP request made using that session whose
URL starts with the given prefix will use the given Transport Adapter.

     Note: The adapter will be chosen based on a longest prefix match.
     Be mindful prefixes such as ‘http://localhost’ will also match
     ‘http://localhost.other.com’ or ‘http://localhost@other.com’.  It’s
     recommended to terminate full hostnames with a ‘/’.

Many of the details of implementing a Transport Adapter are beyond the
scope of this documentation, but take a look at the next example for a
simple SSL use- case.  For more than that, you might look at subclassing
the *note BaseAdapter: 6a.

2.3.20.1 Example: Specific SSL Version
......................................

The Requests team has made a specific choice to use whatever SSL version
is default in the underlying library (urllib3(1)).  Normally this is
fine, but from time to time, you might find yourself needing to connect
to a service-endpoint that uses a version that isn’t compatible with the
default.

You can use Transport Adapters for this by taking most of the existing
implementation of HTTPAdapter, and adding a parameter 'ssl_version' that
gets passed-through to ‘urllib3’.  We’ll make a Transport Adapter that
instructs the library to use SSLv3:

     import ssl
     from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

     from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter


     class Ssl3HttpAdapter(HTTPAdapter):
         """"Transport adapter" that allows us to use SSLv3."""

         def init_poolmanager(self, connections, maxsize, block=False):
             self.poolmanager = PoolManager(
                 num_pools=connections, maxsize=maxsize,
                 block=block, ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3)

By default, Requests does not retry failed connections.  However, it is
possible to implement automatic retries with a powerful array of
features, including backoff, within a Requests *note Session: 36. using
the urllib3.util.Retry(1) class:

     from urllib3.util import Retry
     from requests import Session
     from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter

     s = Session()
     retries = Retry(
         total=3,
         backoff_factor=0.1,
         status_forcelist=[502, 503, 504],
         allowed_methods={'POST'},
     )
     s.mount('https://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))

2.3.21 Blocking Or Non-Blocking?
--------------------------------

With the default Transport Adapter in place, Requests does not provide
any kind of non-blocking IO. The *note Response.content: 41. property
will block until the entire response has been downloaded.  If you
require more granularity, the streaming features of the library (see
*note Streaming Requests: 56.) allow you to retrieve smaller quantities
of the response at a time.  However, these calls will still block.

If you are concerned about the use of blocking IO, there are lots of
projects out there that combine Requests with one of Python’s
asynchronicity frameworks.  Some excellent examples are
requests-threads(1), grequests(2), requests-futures(3), and httpx(4).

2.3.22 Header Ordering
----------------------

In unusual circumstances you may want to provide headers in an ordered
manner.  If you pass an ‘OrderedDict’ to the ‘headers’ keyword argument,
that will provide the headers with an ordering.  'However', the ordering
of the default headers used by Requests will be preferred, which means
that if you override default headers in the ‘headers’ keyword argument,
they may appear out of order compared to other headers in that keyword
argument.

If this is problematic, users should consider setting the default
headers on a *note Session: 36. object, by setting *note
Session.headers: 71. to a custom ‘OrderedDict’.  That ordering will
always be preferred.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Timeouts<2>,  Prev: Header Ordering,  Up: Advanced Usage

2.3.23 Timeouts
---------------

Most requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in
case the server is not responding in a timely manner.  By default,
requests do not time out unless a timeout value is set explicitly.
Without a timeout, your code may hang for minutes or more.

The 'connect' timeout is the number of seconds Requests will wait for
your client to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding
to the connect()(1)) call on the socket.  It’s a good practice to set
connect timeouts to slightly larger than a multiple of 3, which is the
default TCP packet retransmission window(2).

Once your client has connected to the server and sent the HTTP request,
the 'read' timeout is the number of seconds the client will wait for the
server to send a response.  (Specifically, it’s the number of seconds
that the client will wait 'between' bytes sent from the server.  In
99.9% of cases, this is the time before the server sends the first
byte).

If you specify a single value for the timeout, like this:

     r = requests.get('https://github.com', timeout=5)

The timeout value will be applied to both the ‘connect’ and the ‘read’
timeouts.  Specify a tuple if you would like to set the values
separately:

     r = requests.get('https://github.com', timeout=(3.05, 27))

If the remote server is very slow, you can tell Requests to wait forever
for a response, by passing None as a timeout value and then retrieving a
cup of coffee.

     r = requests.get('https://github.com', timeout=None)

     Note: The connect timeout applies to each connection attempt to an
     IP address.  If multiple addresses exist for a domain name, the
     underlying ‘urllib3’ will try each address sequentially until one
     successfully connects.  This may lead to an effective total
     connection timeout 'multiple' times longer than the specified time,
     e.g.  an unresponsive server having both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
     will have its perceived timeout 'doubled', so take that into
     account when setting the connection timeout.

     Note: Neither the connect nor read timeouts are wall clock(3).
     This means that if you start a request, and look at the time, and
     then look at the time when the request finishes or times out, the
     real-world time may be greater than what you specified.

2.4 Authentication
==================

This document discusses using various kinds of authentication with
Requests.

Many web services require authentication, and there are many different
types.  Below, we outline various forms of authentication available in
Requests, from the simple to the complex.

* Menu:

* Basic Authentication::
* Digest Authentication::
* OAuth 1 Authentication::
* OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect Authentication::
* Other Authentication::
* New Forms of Authentication::


File: Requests.info,  Node: Basic Authentication,  Next: Digest Authentication,  Up: Authentication

2.4.1 Basic Authentication
--------------------------

Many web services that require authentication accept HTTP Basic Auth.
This is the simplest kind, and Requests supports it straight out of the
box.

Making requests with HTTP Basic Auth is very simple:

     >>> from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
     >>> basic = HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'pass')
     >>> requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=basic)
     <Response [200]>

In fact, HTTP Basic Auth is so common that Requests provides a handy
shorthand for using it:

     >>> requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
     <Response [200]>

Providing the credentials in a tuple like this is exactly the same as
the ‘HTTPBasicAuth’ example above.

* Menu:

* netrc Authentication::


File: Requests.info,  Node: netrc Authentication,  Up: Basic Authentication

2.4.1.1 netrc Authentication
............................

If no authentication method is given with the ‘auth’ argument, Requests
will attempt to get the authentication credentials for the URL’s
hostname from the user’s netrc file.  The netrc file overrides raw HTTP
authentication headers set with ‘headers=’.

If credentials for the hostname are found, the request is sent with HTTP
Basic Auth.

Requests will search for the netrc file at ‘~/.netrc’, ‘~/_netrc’, or at
the path specified by the ‘NETRC’ environment variable.  ‘~’ denotes the
user’s home directory, which is ‘$HOME’ on Unix based systems and
‘%USERPROFILE%’ on Windows.

Usage of netrc file can be disabled by setting ‘trust_env’ to ‘False’ in
the Requests session:

     >>> s = requests.Session()
     >>> s.trust_env = False
     >>> s.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass')


File: Requests.info,  Node: Digest Authentication,  Next: OAuth 1 Authentication,  Prev: Basic Authentication,  Up: Authentication

2.4.2 Digest Authentication
---------------------------

Another very popular form of HTTP Authentication is Digest
Authentication, and Requests supports this out of the box as well:

     >>> from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass'
     >>> requests.get(url, auth=HTTPDigestAuth('user', 'pass'))
     <Response [200]>


File: Requests.info,  Node: OAuth 1 Authentication,  Next: OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect Authentication,  Prev: Digest Authentication,  Up: Authentication

2.4.3 OAuth 1 Authentication
----------------------------

A common form of authentication for several web APIs is OAuth.  The
‘requests-oauthlib’ library allows Requests users to easily make OAuth 1
authenticated requests:

     >>> import requests
     >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1

     >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/verify_credentials.json'
     >>> auth = OAuth1('YOUR_APP_KEY', 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
     ...               'USER_OAUTH_TOKEN', 'USER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET')

     >>> requests.get(url, auth=auth)
     <Response [200]>

For more information on how to OAuth flow works, please see the official
OAuth(1) website.  For examples and documentation on requests-oauthlib,
please see the requests_oauthlib(2) repository on GitHub

2.4.4 OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect Authentication
-----------------------------------------------

The ‘requests-oauthlib’ library also handles OAuth 2, the authentication
mechanism underpinning OpenID Connect.  See the requests-oauthlib OAuth2
documentation(1) for details of the various OAuth 2 credential
management flows:

   * Web Application Flow(2)

   * Mobile Application Flow(3)

   * Legacy Application Flow(4)

   * Backend Application Flow(5)

2.4.5 Other Authentication
--------------------------

Requests is designed to allow other forms of authentication to be easily
and quickly plugged in.  Members of the open-source community frequently
write authentication handlers for more complicated or less commonly-used
forms of authentication.  Some of the best have been brought together
under the Requests organization(1), including:

   - Kerberos(2)

   - NTLM(3)

If you want to use any of these forms of authentication, go straight to
their GitHub page and follow the instructions.

File: Requests.info,  Node: New Forms of Authentication,  Prev: Other Authentication,  Up: Authentication

2.4.6 New Forms of Authentication
---------------------------------

If you can’t find a good implementation of the form of authentication
you want, you can implement it yourself.  Requests makes it easy to add
your own forms of authentication.

To do so, subclass *note AuthBase: 52. and implement the ‘__call__()’
method:

     >>> import requests
     >>> class MyAuth(requests.auth.AuthBase):
     ...     def __call__(self, r):
     ...         # Implement my authentication
     ...         return r
     ...
     >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/get'
     >>> requests.get(url, auth=MyAuth())
     <Response [200]>

When an authentication handler is attached to a request, it is called
during request setup.  The ‘__call__’ method must therefore do whatever
is required to make the authentication work.  Some forms of
authentication will additionally add hooks to provide further
functionality.

Further examples can be found under the Requests organization(1) and in
the ‘auth.py’ file.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Requests-Toolbelt,  Next: Requests-Threads,  Prev: CacheControl,  Up: Recommended Packages and Extensions

3.1.3 Requests-Toolbelt
-----------------------

Requests-Toolbelt(1) is a collection of utilities that some users of
Requests may desire, but do not belong in Requests proper.  This library
is actively maintained by members of the Requests core team, and
reflects the functionality most requested by users within the community.

3.1.4 Requests-Threads
----------------------

Requests-Threads(1) is a Requests session that returns the amazing
Twisted’s awaitable Deferreds instead of Response objects.  This allows
the use of ‘async’/‘await’ keyword usage on Python 3, or Twisted’s style
of programming, if desired.

3.1.5 Requests-OAuthlib
-----------------------

requests-oauthlib(1) makes it possible to do the OAuth dance from
Requests automatically.  This is useful for the large number of websites
that use OAuth to provide authentication.  It also provides a lot of
tweaks that handle ways that specific OAuth providers differ from the
standard specifications.

File: Requests.info,  Node: Encoded Data?,  Next: Custom User-Agents?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

3.2.1 Encoded Data?
-------------------

Requests automatically decompresses gzip-encoded responses, and does its
best to decode response content to unicode when possible.

When either the brotli(1) or brotlicffi(2) package is installed,
requests also decodes Brotli-encoded responses.

You can get direct access to the raw response (and even the socket), if
needed as well.

3.2.2 Custom User-Agents?
-------------------------

Requests allows you to easily override User-Agent strings, along with
any other HTTP Header.  See *note documentation about headers: 17.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Why not Httplib2?,  Next: Python 3 Support?,  Prev: Custom User-Agents?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

3.2.3 Why not Httplib2?
-----------------------

Chris Adams gave an excellent summary on Hacker News(1):

     httplib2 is part of why you should use requests: it’s far more
     respectable as a client but not as well documented and it still
     takes way too much code for basic operations.  I appreciate what
     httplib2 is trying to do, that there’s a ton of hard low-level
     annoyances in building a modern HTTP client, but really, just use
     requests instead.  Kenneth Reitz is very motivated and he gets the
     degree to which simple things should be simple whereas httplib2
     feels more like an academic exercise than something people should
     use to build production systems[1].

     Disclosure: I’m listed in the requests AUTHORS file but can claim
     credit for, oh, about 0.0001% of the awesomeness.

     1.  ‘http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=96’ is a
     good example: an annoying bug which affect many people, there was a
     fix available for months, which worked great when I applied it in a
     fork and pounded a couple TB of data through it, but it took over a
     year to make it into trunk and even longer to make it onto PyPI
     where any other project which required ” httplib2” would get the
     working version.

3.2.5 Python 2 Support?
-----------------------

No!  As of Requests 2.28.0, Requests no longer supports Python 2.7.
Users who have been unable to migrate should pin to ‘requests<2.28’.
Full information can be found in psf/requests#6023(1).

It is 'highly' recommended users migrate to a supported Python 3.x
version now since Python 2.7 is no longer receiving bug fixes or
security updates as of January 1, 2020.

File: Requests.info,  Node: What are “hostname doesn’t match” errors?,  Prev: Python 2 Support?,  Up: Frequently Asked Questions

3.2.6 What are “hostname doesn’t match” errors?
-----------------------------------------------

These errors occur when *note SSL certificate verification: 3b. fails to
match the certificate the server responds with to the hostname Requests
thinks it’s contacting.  If you’re certain the server’s SSL setup is
correct (for example, because you can visit the site with your browser)
and you’re using Python 2.7, a possible explanation is that you need
Server-Name-Indication.

Server-Name-Indication(1), or SNI, is an official extension to SSL where
the client tells the server what hostname it is contacting.  This is
important when servers are using Virtual Hosting(2).  When such servers
are hosting more than one SSL site they need to be able to return the
appropriate certificate based on the hostname the client is connecting
to.

Python 3 already includes native support for SNI in their SSL modules.

3.7 Release Process and Rules
=============================

Added in version v2.6.2.

Starting with the version to be released after ‘v2.6.2’, the following
rules will govern and describe how the Requests core team produces a new
release.

* Menu:

* Major Releases::
* Minor Releases::
* Hotfix Releases::
* Reasoning::


File: Requests.info,  Node: Major Releases,  Next: Minor Releases,  Up: Release Process and Rules

3.7.1 Major Releases
--------------------

A major release will include breaking changes.  When it is versioned, it
will be versioned as ‘vX.0.0’.  For example, if the previous release was
‘v10.2.7’ the next version will be ‘v11.0.0’.

Breaking changes are changes that break backwards compatibility with
prior versions.  If the project were to change the ‘text’ attribute on a
‘Response’ object to a method, that would only happen in a Major
release.

Major releases may also include miscellaneous bug fixes.  The core
developers of Requests are committed to providing a good user
experience.  This means we’re also committed to preserving backwards
compatibility as much as possible.  Major releases will be infrequent
and will need strong justifications before they are considered.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Minor Releases,  Next: Hotfix Releases,  Prev: Major Releases,  Up: Release Process and Rules

3.7.2 Minor Releases
--------------------

A minor release will not include breaking changes but may include
miscellaneous bug fixes.  If the previous version of Requests released
was ‘v10.2.7’ a minor release would be versioned as ‘v10.3.0’.

Minor releases will be backwards compatible with releases that have the
same major version number.  In other words, all versions that would
start with ‘v10.’ should be compatible with each other.


File: Requests.info,  Node: Hotfix Releases,  Next: Reasoning,  Prev: Minor Releases,  Up: Release Process and Rules

3.7.3 Hotfix Releases
---------------------

A hotfix release will only include bug fixes that were missed when the
project released the previous version.  If the previous version of
Requests released ‘v10.2.7’ the hotfix release would be versioned as
‘v10.2.8’.

Hotfixes will 'not' include upgrades to vendored dependencies after
‘v2.6.2’


File: Requests.info,  Node: Reasoning,  Prev: Hotfix Releases,  Up: Release Process and Rules

3.7.4 Reasoning
---------------

In the 2.5 and 2.6 release series, the Requests core team upgraded
vendored dependencies and caused a great deal of headaches for both
users and the core team.  To reduce this pain, we’re forming a concrete
set of procedures so expectations will be properly set.

3.9.2 2.32.5 (2025-08-18)
-------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - The SSLContext caching feature originally introduced in 2.32.0 has
     created a new class of issues in Requests that have had negative
     impact across a number of use cases.  The Requests team has decided
     to revert this feature as long term maintenance of it is proving to
     be unsustainable in its current iteration.

'Deprecations' - Added support for Python 3.14.  - Dropped support for
Python 3.8 following its end of support.

3.9.3 2.32.4 (2025-06-10)
-------------------------

'Security' - CVE-2024-47081 Fixed an issue where a maliciously crafted
URL and trusted

     environment will retrieve credentials for the wrong
     hostname/machine from a netrc file.

'Improvements' - Numerous documentation improvements

'Deprecations' - Added support for pypy 3.11 for Linux and macOS. -
Dropped support for pypy 3.9 following its end of support.

3.9.4 2.32.3 (2024-05-29)
-------------------------

'Bugfixes' - Fixed bug breaking the ability to specify custom
SSLContexts in sub-classes of

     HTTPAdapter.  (#6716)

   - Fixed issue where Requests started failing to run on Python
     versions compiled without the ‘ssl’ module.  (#6724)


File: Requests.info,  Node: 2 32 2 2024-05-21,  Next: 2 32 1 2024-05-20,  Prev: 2 32 3 2024-05-29,  Up: Release History

3.9.5 2.32.2 (2024-05-21)
-------------------------

'Deprecations' - To provide a more stable migration for custom
HTTPAdapters impacted

     by the CVE changes in 2.32.0, we’ve renamed ‘_get_connection’ to a
     new public API, ‘get_connection_with_tls_context’.  Existing custom
     HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API.
     ‘get_connection’ is considered deprecated in all versions of
     Requests>=2.32.0.

     A minimal (2-line) example has been provided in the linked PR to
     ease migration, but we strongly urge users to evaluate if their
     custom adapter is subject to the same issue described in
     CVE-2024-35195.  (#6710)

3.9.6 2.32.1 (2024-05-20)
-------------------------

'Bugfixes' - Add missing test certs to the sdist distributed on PyPI.


File: Requests.info,  Node: 2 32 0 2024-05-20,  Next: 2 31 0 2023-05-22,  Prev: 2 32 1 2024-05-20,  Up: Release History

3.9.7 2.32.0 (2024-05-20)
-------------------------

'Security' - Fixed an issue where setting ‘verify=False’ on the first
request from a

     Session will cause subsequent requests to the _same >>origin_<< to
     also ignore cert verification, regardless of the value of ‘verify’.
     (‘https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56’)

'Improvements' - ‘verify=True’ now reuses a global SSLContext which
should improve

     request time variance between first and subsequent requests.  It
     should also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when
     using a Python version built with OpenSSL 3.x.  (#6667)

   - Requests now supports optional use of character detection
     (‘chardet’ or ‘charset_normalizer’) when repackaged or vendored.
     This enables ‘pip’ and other projects to minimize their vendoring
     surface area.  The ‘Response.text()’ and ‘apparent_encoding’ APIs
     will default to ‘utf-8’ if neither library is present.  (#6702)

'Bugfixes' - Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was
incorrectly

     calculated in the request content-length.  (#6589)

   - Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError.  (#6629)

   - Fixed bug where an extra leading ‘/’ (path separator) could lead
     urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)

'Deprecations'

   - Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)

   - Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)

   - Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)

   - Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8
     (#6641)

'Documentation' - Various typo fixes and doc improvements.

'Packaging' - Requests has started adopting some modern packaging
practices.

     The source files for the projects (formerly ‘requests’) is now
     located in ‘src/requests’ in the Requests sdist.  (#6506)

   - Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517
     build system using ‘hatchling’.  This should not impact the average
     user, but extremely old versions of packaging utilities may have
     issues with the new packaging format.


File: Requests.info,  Node: 2 31 0 2023-05-22,  Next: 2 30 0 2023-05-03,  Prev: 2 32 0 2024-05-20,  Up: Release History

3.9.8 2.31.0 (2023-05-22)
-------------------------

'Security' - Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are
vulnerable to potential

     forwarding of ‘Proxy-Authorization’ headers to destination servers
     when following HTTPS redirects.

     When proxies are defined with user info
     (‘https://user:pass@proxy:8080’), Requests will construct a
     ‘Proxy-Authorization’ header that is attached to the request to
     authenticate with the proxy.

     In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously
     reattached the ‘Proxy-Authorization’ header incorrectly, resulting
     in the value being sent through the tunneled connection to the
     destination server.  Users who rely on defining their proxy
     credentials in the URL are 'strongly' encouraged to upgrade to
     Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their
     proxy credentials once the change has been fully deployed.

     Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy
     credentials through the user information portion of their proxy URL
     are not subject to this vulnerability.

     Full details can be read in our [Github Security
     Advisory](‘https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q’)

     testing and reviewing
     ‘https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html’
     prior to upgrading.

     Users who wish to stay on urllib3 1.x can pin to ‘urllib3<2’.

3.9.13 2.28.0 (2022-06-09)
--------------------------

'Deprecations'

   - ⚠️ Requests has officially dropped support for Python 2.7.  ⚠️
     (#6091)

   - Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.6 (including
     pypy3.6).  (#6091)

'Improvements'

   - Wrap JSON parsing issues in Request’s JSONDecodeError for payloads
     without an encoding to make ‘json()’ API consistent.  (#6097)

   - Parse header components consistently, raising an InvalidHeader
     error in all invalid cases.  (#6154)

   - Added provisional 3.11 support with current beta build.  (#6155)

   - Requests got a makeover and we decided to paint it black.  (#6095)

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed bug where setting ‘CURL_CA_BUNDLE’ to an empty string would
     disable cert verification.  All Requests 2.x versions before 2.28.0
     are affected.  (#6074)

   - Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping
     ‘urllib3.exceptions.SSLError’ with ‘requests.exceptions.SSLError’

   - Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entries caused proxy
     resolution to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry.
     (#6149)

   - Fixed issue where entire payload could be included in the error
     message for JSONDecodeError.  (#6036)

3.9.15 2.27.0 (2022-01-03)
--------------------------

'Improvements'

   - Officially added support for Python 3.10.  (#5928)

   - Added a ‘requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError’ to unify JSON
     exceptions between Python 2 and 3.  This gets raised in the
     ‘response.json()’ method, and is backwards compatible as it
     inherits from previously thrown exceptions.  Can be caught from
     ‘requests.exceptions.RequestException’ as well.  (#5856)

   - Improved error text for misnamed ‘InvalidSchema’ and
     ‘MissingSchema’ exceptions.  This is a temporary fix until
     exceptions can be renamed (Schema->Scheme).  (#6017)

   - Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme.  This will
     address recent changes to ‘urlparse’ in Python 3.9+.  (#5917)

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed defect in ‘extract_zipped_paths’ which could result in an
     infinite loop for some paths.  (#5851)

   - Fixed handling for ‘AttributeError’ when calculating length of
     files obtained by ‘Tarfile.extractfile()’.  (#5239)

   - Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping
     ‘urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader’ with
     ‘requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader’.  (#5914)

   - Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests.
     (#5391)

   - Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where ‘Proxy-Authorization’ was
     incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with ‘Session.send’.
     (#5924)

   - Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large
     number of proxies available in the environment.  (#5924)

   - Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping ‘UnicodeError’ with
     ‘requests.exceptions.InvalidURL’ for URLs with a leading dot (.)
     in the domain.  (#5414)

'Deprecations'

   - Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022.
     While we don’t have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be
     the last release series providing support.

3.9.16 2.26.0 (2021-07-13)
--------------------------

'Improvements'

   - Requests now supports Brotli compression, if either the ‘brotli’ or
     ‘brotlicffi’ package is installed.  (#5783)

   - ‘Session.send’ now correctly resolves proxy configurations from
     both the Session and Request.  Behavior now matches
     ‘Session.request’.  (#5681)

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed a race condition in zip extraction when using Requests in
     parallel from zip archive.  (#5707)

'Dependencies'

   - Instead of ‘chardet’, use the MIT-licensed ‘charset_normalizer’ for
     Python3 to remove license ambiguity for projects bundling requests.
     If ‘chardet’ is already installed on your machine it will be used
     instead of ‘charset_normalizer’ to keep backwards compatibility.
     (#5797)

     You can also install ‘chardet’ while installing requests by
     specifying ‘[use_chardet_on_py3]’ extra as follows:

          ‘`shell pip install "requests[use_chardet_on_py3]" `’

     Python2 still depends upon the ‘chardet’ module.

   - Requests now supports ‘idna’ 3.x on Python 3.  ‘idna’ 2.x will
     continue to be used on Python 2 installations.  (#5711)

'Deprecations'

   - The ‘requests[security]’ extra has been converted to a no-op
     install.  PyOpenSSL is no longer the recommended secure option for
     Requests.  (#5867)

   - Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.5.  (#5867)

3.9.19 2.24.0 (2020-06-17)
--------------------------

'Improvements'

   - pyOpenSSL TLS implementation is now only used if Python either
     doesn’t have an ‘ssl’ module or doesn’t support SNI. Previously
     pyOpenSSL was unconditionally used if available.  This applies even
     if pyOpenSSL is installed via the ‘requests[security]’ extra
     (#5443)

   - Redirect resolution should now only occur when ‘allow_redirects’ is
     True.  (#5492)

   - No longer perform unnecessary Content-Length calculation for
     requests that won’t use it.  (#5496)

   - Pinning for ‘chardet’ and ‘idna’ now uses major version instead of
     minor.  This hopefully reduces the need for releases every time a
     dependency is updated.

3.9.24 2.20.0 (2018-10-18)
--------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Content-Type header parsing is now case-insensitive (e.g.
     charset=utf8 v Charset=utf8).

   - Fixed exception leak where certain redirect urls would raise
     uncaught urllib3 exceptions.

   - Requests removes Authorization header from requests redirected from
     https to http on the same hostname.  (CVE-2018-18074)

     do not support ‘winreg’ module.

   - DNS resolution in proxy bypass no longer includes the username and
     password in the request.  This also fixes the issue of DNS queries
     failing on macOS.

   - Properly normalize adapter prefixes for url comparison.

     version of idna.

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed issue where Requests would raise ‘ConnectionError’ instead of

   - Restored the ‘requests.packages’ namespace for compatibility
     reasons.

   - Bugfix for ‘urllib3’ version parsing.

'Note': code that was written to import against the ‘requests.packages’
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this
module-level now.

For example:

     from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be:

     from requests.packages import urllib3
     urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better:

     from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

3.9.43 2.15.0 (2017-05-26)
--------------------------

'Improvements'

   - Introduction of the ‘Response.next’ property, for getting the next
     ‘PreparedResponse’ from a redirect chain (when
     ‘allow_redirects=False’).

   - Internal refactoring of ‘__version__’ module.

'Bugfixes'

3.9.46 2.14.0 (2017-05-09)
--------------------------

'Improvements'

   - It is now possible to pass ‘no_proxy’ as a key to the ‘proxies’
     dictionary to provide handling similar to the ‘NO_PROXY’
     environment variable.

   - When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or
     directories Requests now raises ‘IOError’, rather than failing at
     the time of the HTTPS request with a fairly inscrutable certificate
     validation error.

   - The behavior of ‘SessionRedirectMixin’ was slightly altered.
     ‘resolve_redirects’ will now detect a redirect by calling
     ‘get_redirect_target(response)’ instead of directly querying
     ‘Response.is_redirect’ and ‘Response.headers[‘location’]’.
     Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more
     easily.

   - Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have
     higher resolution on Windows.

   - Added ‘win_inet_pton’ as conditional dependency for the ‘[socks]’
     extra on Windows with Python 2.7.

   - Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy
     bypass check doesn’t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore

   - URLs with schemes that begin with ‘http’ but are not ‘http’ or
     ‘https’ no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

'Bugfixes'

   - Much improved handling of non-ASCII ‘Location’ header values in
     redirects.  Fewer ‘UnicodeDecodeErrors’ are encountered on Python
     2, and Python 3 now correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely
     to be the correct encoding.

   - If an attempt to ‘seek’ file to find out its length fails, we now
     appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length
     calculations.

   - Restricted ‘HTTPDigestAuth’ to only respond to auth challenges made
     on 4XX responses, rather than to all auth challenges.

   - Fixed some code that was firing ‘DeprecationWarning’ on Python 3.6.

   - The dismayed person emoticon (‘/o\’) no longer has a big head.  I’m
     sure this is what you were all worrying about most.

'Miscellaneous'

   - Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.

   - Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.

   - Updated bundled idna to v2.5.

   - Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.

3.9.47 2.13.0 (2017-01-24)
--------------------------

'Features'

   - Only load the ‘idna’ library when we’ve determined we need it.
     This will save some memory for users.

3.9.49 2.12.4 (2016-12-14)
--------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected
     in the basic auth parameters.  While support for this behaviour has
     been re-added, the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in
     the future.

3.9.50 2.12.3 (2016-12-01)
--------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with
     “http”.  These URLs have historically been processed as though they
     were HTTP-schemed URLs, and so have had parameters added.  This was
     removed in v2.12.2 in an overzealous attempt to resolve problems
     with IDNA-encoding those URLs.  This change was reverted: the other
     fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to be sufficient to return
     to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.

3.9.51 2.12.2 (2016-11-30)
--------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically
     invalid but which are widely accepted.  Requests will now attempt
     to IDNA-encode a URL if it can but, if it fails, and the host
     contains only ASCII characters, it will be passed through
     optimistically.  This will allow users to opt-in to using IDNA2003
     themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
     but still common hostnames.

   - Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
     ‘InvalidSchema’ errors.

   - Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes
     would still have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.

   - Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic
     auth.

   - Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where
     constructing a Response object would cause ‘Response.content’ to
     raise an ‘AttributeError’.

3.9.52 2.12.1 (2016-11-16)
--------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Updated setuptools ‘security’ extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend
     in urllib3.

'Miscellaneous'

   - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.


File: Requests.info,  Node: 2 12 0 2016-11-15,  Next: 2 11 1 2016-08-17,  Prev: 2 12 1 2016-11-16,  Up: Release History

3.9.53 2.12.0 (2016-11-15)
--------------------------

'Improvements'

   - Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to
     IDNA2008.  This updated support is required for several forms of
     IDNs and is mandatory for .de domains.

   - Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests
     will no longer read an entire ‘StringIO’ into memory.

   - Much improved logic for recalculating ‘Content-Length’ headers for
     ‘PreparedRequest’ objects.

   - Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ‘tell’ method
     but do have a ‘seek’ method.

   - Anything that is a subclass of ‘Mapping’ is now treated like a
     dictionary by the ‘data=’ keyword argument.

   - Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather
     than stripping the credentials.

   - If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that
     request is redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will
     now attempt to rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

'Bugfixes'

   - When calling ‘response.close’, the call to ‘close’ will be
     propagated through to non-urllib3 backends.

   - Fixed issue where the ‘ALL_PROXY’ environment variable would be
     preferred over scheme-specific variables like ‘HTTP_PROXY’.

   - Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by
     falling back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.

   - Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies
     set when using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not
     use the native string type for the platform.

'Miscellaneous'

   - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.

   - Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.

3.9.54 2.11.1 (2016-08-17)
--------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed a bug when using ‘iter_content’ with ‘decode_unicode=True’
     for streamed bodies would raise ‘AttributeError’.  This bug was
     introduced in 2.11.

   - Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header
     block when following a redirect that transforms the verb from
     POST/PUT to GET.

3.9.55 2.11.0 (2016-08-08)
--------------------------

'Improvements'

   - Added support for the ‘ALL_PROXY’ environment variable.

   - Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline
     characters to reduce risk of header smuggling.

'Bugfixes'

   - Fixed occasional ‘TypeError’ when attempting to decode a JSON
     response that occurred in an error case.  Now correctly returns a
     ‘ValueError’.

   - Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the
     ‘NO_PROXY’ environment variables: Requests now treats it as a
     specific IP.

   - Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter
     obscure OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).

   - Added type checks to ensure that ‘iter_content’ only accepts
     integers and ‘None’ for chunk sizes.

   - Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed
     would have the underlying connection closed but not returned to the
     connection pool, which could cause Requests to hang in situations
     where the ‘HTTPAdapter’ had been configured to use a blocking
     connection pool.

'Miscellaneous'

   - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.

   - Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as
     acceptable header values.  This release does not.

3.9.56 2.10.0 (2016-04-29)
--------------------------

'New Features'

   - SOCKS Proxy Support!  (requires PySocks; ‘$ pip install
     requests[socks]’)

3.9.57 2.9.2 (2016-04-29)
-------------------------

'Improvements'

   - Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use
     OrderedDict as its underlying datastore.

'Bugfixes'

   - Don’t use redirect_cache if allow_redirects=False

   - When passed objects that throw exceptions from ‘tell()’, send them
     via chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.

   - Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.

   - Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to
     send binary strings as bodies in Python 3.

   - Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain
     locales.

'Miscellaneous'

   - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.

3.9.59 2.9.0 (2015-12-15)
-------------------------

'Minor Improvements' (Backwards compatible)

   - The ‘verify’ keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a
     directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.

   - Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.

   - Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the
     status code registry.

'Bugfixes'

   - For file-like objects that are not sought to the very beginning, we
     now send the content length for the number of bytes we will
     actually read, rather than the total size of the file, allowing
     partial file uploads.

   - When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no
     obvious content length we set ‘Transfer-Encoding: chunked’ rather
     than ‘Content-Length: 0’.

   - We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading
     chunked bodies.

   - We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python
     3, by decoding it as UTF-8.

   - Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when
     using the functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the
     garbage collector to clean them up.

   - Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed ‘qop’
     directive that contains no token, by treating it the same as if no
     ‘qop’ directive was provided at all.

   - Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by
     name.

'Miscellaneous'

   - Updated urllib3 to 1.13.

3.9.60 2.8.1 (2015-10-13)
-------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Update certificate bundle to match ‘certifi’ 2015.9.6.2’s weak
     certificate bundle.

   - Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise ‘ConnectTimeout’
     instead of ‘ConnectionError’

   - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly
     respect the ‘json’ parameter.  Broken in 2.8.0.

   - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly
     handle a Unicode-string method name on Python 2.  Broken in 2.8.0.

3.9.61 2.8.0 (2015-10-05)
-------------------------

'Minor Improvements' (Backwards Compatible)

   - Requests now supports per-host proxies.  This allows the ‘proxies’
     dictionary to have entries of the form ‘{‘<scheme>://<hostname>’:
     ‘<proxy>’}’.  Host-specific proxies will be used in preference to
     the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the previous
     syntax will continue to work.

   - ‘Response.raise_for_status’ now prints the URL that failed as part
     of the exception message.

   - ‘requests.utils.get_netrc_auth’ now takes an ‘raise_errors’ kwarg,
     defaulting to ‘False’.  When ‘True’, errors parsing ‘.netrc’ files
     cause exceptions to be thrown.

   - Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to
     unbundle requests downstream.

   - Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on
     Linux: now contains only the requests version.

'Bugfixes'

   - The ‘json’ parameter to ‘post()’ and friends will now only be used
     if neither ‘data’ nor ‘files’ are present, consistent with the
     documentation.

   - We now ignore empty fields in the ‘NO_PROXY’ environment variable.

   - Fixed problem where ‘httplib.BadStatusLine’ would get raised if
     combining ‘stream=True’ with ‘contextlib.closing’.

   - Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection
     back to the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.

   - Miscellaneous minor internal changes.

   - Digest Auth support is now thread safe.

'Updates'

   - Updated urllib3 to 1.12.

3.9.64 2.6.1 (2015-04-22)
-------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.

   - Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the
     user to pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument.  (c.f.
     #2552)

   - Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original
     arguments to the adapter.  (#2503)

   - Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL
     that cannot be encoded in ASCII. (#2540)

   - Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest
     Authentication.  (#2426)

   - Copy a PreparedRequest’s CookieJar more reliably when it is not an
     instance of RequestsCookieJar.  (#2527)

3.9.65 2.6.0 (2015-03-14)
-------------------------

'Bugfixes'

   - CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect.  Previously a
     cookie without a host value set would use the hostname for the
     redirected URL exposing requests users to session fixation attacks
     and potentially cookie stealing.  This was disclosed privately by
     Matthew Daley of [BugFuzz](‘https://bugfuzz.com’).  This affects
     all versions of requests from v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both
     ends).

   - Fix error when requests is an ‘install_requires’ dependency and
     ‘python setup.py test’ is run.  (#2462)

   - Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use
     the vendored import location.

   - Include fixes to ‘urllib3’’s header handling.

   - Requests’ handling of unvendored dependencies is now more
     restrictive.

'Features and Improvements'

   - Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the ‘files’
     argument.  (#2468)

   - Avoid data duplication when creating a request with ‘str’, ‘bytes’,
     or ‘bytearray’ input to the ‘files’ argument.

   - Improve the performance of headers.
     ([shazow/urllib3#544](‘https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/544’))

'Bugfixes'

   - Copy pip’s import machinery.  When downstream redistributors remove
     requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let
     those same symbols work.  Example usage in requests’ documentation
     and 3rd-party libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3
     will work without having to fallback to the system urllib3.

   - Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then
     quoting fails.  (#2356)

   - Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads.  (#2411)

   - Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest
     authentication challenges provides both auth and auth-int
     qop-values.  (#2408)

   - Fix a socket leak.
     ([shazow/urllib3#549](‘https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/549’))

   - Fix multiple ‘Set-Cookie’ headers properly.
     ([shazow/urllib3#534](‘https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/534’))

   - Disable the built-in hostname verification.

-------------------------

'Behavioral Changes'

   - ‘Connection: keep-alive’ header is now sent automatically.

'Improvements'

   - Support for connect timeouts!  Timeout now accepts a tuple
     (connect, read) which is used to set individual connect and read
     timeouts.

   - Allow copying of PreparedRequests without headers/cookies.

   - Updated bundled urllib3 version.

   - Refactored settings loading from environment – new
     Session.merge_environment_settings.

3.9.74 2.3.0 (2014-05-16)
-------------------------

'API Changes'

   - New ‘Response’ property ‘is_redirect’, which is true when the
     library could have processed this response as a redirection
     (whether or not it actually did).

   - The ‘timeout’ parameter now affects requests with both
     ‘stream=True’ and ‘stream=False’ equally.

   - The change in v2.0.0 to mandate explicit proxy schemes has been
     reverted.  Proxy schemes now default to ‘http://’.

   - The ‘CaseInsensitiveDict’ used for HTTP headers now behaves like a
     normal dictionary when references as string or viewed in the
     interpreter.

'Bugfixes'

   - No longer expose Authorization or Proxy-Authorization headers on
     redirect.  Fix CVE-2014-1829 and CVE-2014-1830 respectively.

   - Authorization is re-evaluated each redirect.

   - On redirect, pass url as native strings.

   - Return connections to the pool when a chunked upload is successful,
     rather than leaking it.

   - Match the HTTPbis recommendation for HTTP 301 redirects.

3.9.79 2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
-------------------------

'API Changes:'

   - Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python
     versions, i.e.  bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.

   - Proxy URLs now 'must' have an explicit scheme.  A ‘MissingSchema’
     exception will be raised if they don’t.

   - Timeouts now apply to read time if ‘Stream=False’.

   - ‘RequestException’ is now a subclass of ‘IOError’, not
     ‘RuntimeError’.

   - Added new method to ‘PreparedRequest’ objects:
     ‘PreparedRequest.copy()’.

   - Added new method to ‘Session’ objects: ‘Session.update_request()’.
     This method updates a ‘Request’ object with the data (e.g.
     cookies) stored on the ‘Session’.

   - Added new method to ‘Session’ objects: ‘Session.prepare_request()’.
     This method updates and prepares a ‘Request’ object, and returns
     the corresponding ‘PreparedRequest’ object.

   - Added new method to ‘HTTPAdapter’ objects:
     ‘HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()’.  This should not be called directly,
     but improves the subclass interface.

   - ‘httplib.IncompleteRead’ exceptions caused by incorrect chunked
     encoding will now raise a Requests ‘ChunkedEncodingError’ instead.

   - Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests ‘InvalidURL’
     exception to be raised.

   - HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase ‘“im_used”’.  Correctly uses
     ‘“already_reported”’.

   - HTTP 226 reason added (‘“im_used”’).

'Bugfixes:'

   - Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb.  Special
     thanks to the many contributors who worked towards this
     improvement.

   - Cookies are now properly managed when 401 authentication responses
     are received.

   - Chunked encoding fixes.

   - Support for mixed case schemes.

   - Better handling of streaming downloads.

   - Retrieve environment proxies from more locations.

   - Minor cookies fixes.

   - Improved redirect behaviour.

   - Improved streaming behaviour, particularly for compressed data.

   - Miscellaneous small Python 3 text encoding bugs.

   - ‘.netrc’ no longer overrides explicit auth.

   - Cookies set by hooks are now correctly persisted on Sessions.

   - Fix problem with cookies that specify port numbers in their host
     field.

   - ‘BytesIO’ can be used to perform streaming uploads.

   - More generous parsing of the ‘no_proxy’ environment variable.

   - Non-string objects can be passed in data values alongside files.

3.9.83 1.2.0 (2013-03-31)
-------------------------

   - Fixed cookies on sessions and on requests

   - Significantly change how hooks are dispatched - hooks now receive
     all the arguments specified by the user when making a request so
     hooks can make a secondary request with the same parameters.  This
     is especially necessary for authentication handler authors

   - certifi support was removed

     data

   - Major proxy work thanks to @Lukasa including parsing of proxy
     authentication from the proxy url

   - Fix DigestAuth handling too many 401s

   - Update vendored urllib3 to include SSL bug fixes

   - Allow keyword arguments to be passed to ‘json.loads()’ via the
     ‘Response.json()’ method

   - Don’t send ‘Content-Length’ header by default on ‘GET’ or ‘HEAD’
     requests

   - Add ‘elapsed’ attribute to ‘Response’ objects to time how long a
     request took.

   - Sessions and Adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the
     multiprocessing library

   - Update charade to version 1.0.3

The change in how hooks are dispatched will likely cause a great deal of
issues.

      -- Method: rebuild_auth (prepared_request, response)

          When being redirected we may want to strip authentication from
          the request to avoid leaking credentials.  This method
          intelligently removes and reapplies authentication where
          possible to avoid credential loss.

      -- Method: rebuild_method (prepared_request, response)

          When being redirected we may want to change the method of the
          request based on certain specs or browser behavior.

      -- Method: rebuild_proxies (prepared_request, proxies)

          This method re-evaluates the proxy configuration by
          considering the environment variables.  If we are redirected
          to a URL covered by NO_PROXY, we strip the proxy
          configuration.  Otherwise, we set missing proxy keys for this
          URL (in case they were stripped by a previous redirect).

          This method also replaces the Proxy-Authorization header where
          necessary.


          Return type: dict(2)

      -- Method: request (method, url, params=None, data=None,
               headers=None, cookies=None, files=None, auth=None,

               json=None)

          Constructs a *note Request: 152, prepares it and sends it.
          Returns *note Response: 11. object.


          Parameters:

             * ‘method’ – method for the new *note Request: 152. object.

             * ‘url’ – URL for the new *note Request: 152. object.

             * ‘params’ – (optional) Dictionary or bytes to be sent in
               the query string for the *note Request: 152.

             * ‘data’ – (optional) Dictionary, list of tuples, bytes, or
               file-like object to send in the body of the *note
               Request: 152.

             * ‘json’ – (optional) json to send in the body of the *note
               Request: 152.

             * ‘auth’ – (optional) Auth tuple or callable to enable
               Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.

             * ‘timeout’ (float(3)‘ or ’tuple(4)) – (optional) How many
               seconds to wait for the server to send data before giving
               up, as a float, or a *note (connect timeout, read
               timeout): 73. tuple.

             * ‘allow_redirects’ (bool(5)) – (optional) Set to True by
               default.

             * ‘proxies’ – (optional) Dictionary mapping protocol or

             * ‘verify’ – (optional) Either a boolean, in which case it
               controls whether we verify the server’s TLS certificate,
               or a string, in which case it must be a path to a CA
               bundle to use.  Defaults to ‘True’.  When set to ‘False’,
               requests will accept any TLS certificate presented by the
               server, and will ignore hostname mismatches and/or
               expired certificates, which will make your application
               vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.  Setting
               verify to ‘False’ may be useful during local development
               or testing.

             * ‘cert’ – (optional) if String, path to ssl client cert
               file (.pem).  If Tuple, (‘cert’, ‘key’) pair.


          Return type: *note requests.Response: 11.

      -- Method: resolve_redirects (resp, req, stream=False,
               timeout=None, verify=True, cert=None, proxies=None,
               yield_requests=False, **adapter_kwargs)

          Receives a Response.  Returns a generator of Responses or
          Requests.

      -- Method: send (request, **kwargs)

          Send a given PreparedRequest.


          Return type: *note requests.Response: 11.

      -- Method: should_strip_auth (old_url, new_url)

      -- Attribute: trust_env

          Trust environment settings for proxy configuration, default
          authentication and similar.

      -- Attribute: verify

          SSL Verification default.  Defaults to ‘True’, requiring
          requests to verify the TLS certificate at the remote end.  If
          verify is set to ‘False’, requests will accept any TLS
          certificate presented by the server, and will ignore hostname
          mismatches and/or expired certificates, which will make your
          application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
          Only set this to ‘False’ for testing.

          multipart upload.

        * ‘data’ – the body to attach to the request.  If a dictionary
          or list of tuples ‘[(key, value)]’ is provided, form-encoding
          will take place.

        * ‘json’ – json for the body to attach to the request (if files
          or data is not specified).

        * ‘params’ – URL parameters to append to the URL. If a
          dictionary or list of tuples ‘[(key, value)]’ is provided,
          form-encoding will take place.

        * ‘auth’ – Auth handler or (user, pass) tuple.

        * ‘cookies’ – dictionary or CookieJar of cookies to attach to
          this request.

        * ‘hooks’ – dictionary of callback hooks, for internal usage.

          The amount of time elapsed between sending the request and the
          arrival of the response (as a timedelta).  This property
          specifically measures the time taken between sending the first
          byte of the request and finishing parsing the headers.  It is
          therefore unaffected by consuming the response content or the
          value of the ‘stream’ keyword argument.

      -- Attribute: encoding

          Encoding to decode with when accessing r.text.

      -- Attribute: headers

          Case-insensitive Dictionary of Response Headers.  For example,
          ‘headers['content-encoding']’ will return the value of a
          ‘'Content-Encoding'’ response header.

      -- Attribute: history

          A list of *note Response: 11. objects from the history of the
          Request.  Any redirect responses will end up here.  The list
          is sorted from the oldest to the most recent request.

      -- Property: is_permanent_redirect

          True if this Response one of the permanent versions of
          redirect.

      -- Property: is_redirect

          True if this Response is a well-formed HTTP redirect that
          could have been processed automatically (by *note
          Session.resolve_redirects: 174.).

      -- Method: iter_content (chunk_size=1, decode_unicode=False)

          Iterates over the response data.  When stream=True is set on
          the request, this avoids reading the content at once into
          memory for large responses.  The chunk size is the number of
          bytes it should read into memory.  This is not necessarily the
          length of each item returned as decoding can take place.

          chunk_size must be of type int or None.  A value of None will
          function differently depending on the value of ‘stream’.
          stream=True will read data as it arrives in whatever size the
          chunks are received.  If stream=False, data is returned as a
          single chunk.

          If decode_unicode is True, content will be decoded using the
          best available encoding based on the response.

      -- Method: iter_lines (chunk_size=512, decode_unicode=False,
               delimiter=None)

          Iterates over the response data, one line at a time.  When
          stream=True is set on the request, this avoids reading the
          content at once into memory for large responses.

               Note: This method is not reentrant safe.

      -- Method: json (**kwargs)

          Decodes the JSON response body (if any) as a Python object.

          This may return a dictionary, list, etc.  depending on what is
          in the response.


          Parameters: ‘**kwargs’ – Optional arguments that ‘json.loads’
          takes.


          Raises: *note requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError: 15c. – If
          the response body does not contain valid json.

      -- Property: links

          Returns the parsed header links of the response, if any.

      -- Property: next

          Returns a PreparedRequest for the next request in a redirect
          chain, if there is one.

      -- Property: ok

          Returns True if *note status_code: 186. is less than 400,
          False if not.

          This attribute checks if the status code of the response is
          between 400 and 600 to see if there was a client error or a
          server error.  If the status code is between 200 and 400, this
          will return True.  This is 'not' a check to see if the
          response code is ‘200 OK’.

      -- Method: raise_for_status ()

          Raises *note HTTPError: 27, if one occurred.

      -- Attribute: raw

          File-like object representation of response (for advanced
          usage).  Use of ‘raw’ requires that ‘stream=True’ be set on
          the request.  This requirement does not apply for use
          internally to Requests.

      -- Attribute: reason

          Textual reason of responded HTTP Status, e.g.  “Not Found” or
          “OK”.

      -- Attribute: request

          The *note PreparedRequest: 37. object to which this is a
          response.

      -- Attribute: status_code

          Integer Code of responded HTTP Status, e.g.  404 or 200.

      -- Property: text

          Content of the response, in unicode.

          If Response.encoding is None, encoding will be guessed using
          ‘charset_normalizer’ or ‘chardet’.

          The encoding of the response content is determined based
          solely on HTTP headers, following RFC 2616 to the letter.  If
          you can take advantage of non-HTTP knowledge to make a better
          guess at the encoding, you should set ‘r.encoding’
          appropriately before accessing this property.

      -- Attribute: url

          Final URL location of Response.

4.1.5 Lower-Lower-Level Classes
-------------------------------

 -- Class: requests.PreparedRequest

     The fully mutable *note PreparedRequest: 37. object, containing the
     exact bytes that will be sent to the server.

     Instances are generated from a *note Request: 152. object, and
     should not be instantiated manually; doing so may produce
     undesirable effects.

     Usage:

          >>> import requests
          >>> req = requests.Request('GET', 'https://httpbin.org/get')
          >>> r = req.prepare()
          >>> r
          <PreparedRequest [GET]>

          >>> s = requests.Session()
          >>> s.send(r)
          <Response [200]>

      -- Attribute: body

          request body to send to the server.

      -- Method: deregister_hook (event, hook)

          Deregister a previously registered hook.  Returns True if the
          hook existed, False if not.

      -- Attribute: headers

          dictionary of HTTP headers.

      -- Attribute: hooks

          dictionary of callback hooks, for internal usage.

      -- Attribute: method

          HTTP verb to send to the server.

      -- Property: path_url

          Build the path URL to use.

      -- Method: prepare (method=None, url=None, headers=None,
               files=None, data=None, params=None, auth=None,
               cookies=None, hooks=None, json=None)

          Prepares the entire request with the given parameters.

      -- Method: prepare_auth (auth, url='')

          Prepares the given HTTP auth data.

      -- Method: prepare_body (data, files, json=None)

          Prepares the given HTTP body data.

      -- Method: prepare_content_length (body)

          Prepare Content-Length header based on request method and body

      -- Method: prepare_cookies (cookies)

          Prepares the given HTTP cookie data.

          This function eventually generates a ‘Cookie’ header from the
          given cookies using cookielib.  Due to cookielib’s design, the
          header will not be regenerated if it already exists, meaning
          this function can only be called once for the life of the
          *note PreparedRequest: 37. object.  Any subsequent calls to
          ‘prepare_cookies’ will have no actual effect, unless the
          “Cookie” header is removed beforehand.

      -- Method: prepare_headers (headers)

          Prepares the given HTTP headers.

      -- Method: prepare_hooks (hooks)

          Prepares the given hooks.

      -- Method: prepare_method (method)

          Prepares the given HTTP method.

      -- Method: prepare_url (url, params)

          Prepares the given HTTP URL.

      -- Method: register_hook (event, hook)

          Properly register a hook.

      -- Attribute: url

          HTTP URL to send the request to.

 -- Class: requests.adapters.BaseAdapter

     The Base Transport Adapter

      -- Method: close ()

          Cleans up adapter specific items.

      -- Method: send (request, stream=False, timeout=None, verify=True,
               cert=None, proxies=None)

          Parameters:

             * ‘request’ – The ‘PreparedRequest’ being sent.

             * ‘stream’ – (optional) Whether to stream the request
               content.

             * ‘timeout’ (float(1)‘ or ’tuple(2)) – (optional) How long
               to wait for the server to send data before giving up, as
               a float, or a *note (connect timeout, read timeout): 73.
               tuple.

             * ‘verify’ – (optional) Either a boolean, in which case it
               controls whether we verify the server’s TLS certificate,
               or a string, in which case it must be a path to a CA
               bundle to use

             * ‘cert’ – (optional) Any user-provided SSL certificate to
               be trusted.

             * ‘proxies’ – (optional) The proxies dictionary to apply to
               the request.

 -- Class: requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter (pool_connections=10,
          pool_maxsize=10, max_retries=0, pool_block=False)

     The built-in HTTP Adapter for urllib3.

     Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact
     HTTP and HTTPS urls by implementing the Transport Adapter
     interface.  This class will usually be created by the ‘Session’
     class under the covers.


     Parameters:

        * ‘pool_connections’ – The number of urllib3 connection pools to
          cache.

        * ‘pool_maxsize’ – The maximum number of connections to save in
          the pool.

        * ‘max_retries’ – The maximum number of retries each connection
          should attempt.  Note, this applies only to failed DNS
          lookups, socket connections and connection timeouts, never to
          requests where data has made it to the server.  By default,
          Requests does not retry failed connections.  If you need
          granular control over the conditions under which we retry a
          request, import urllib3’s ‘Retry’ class and pass that instead.

        * ‘pool_block’ – Whether the connection pool should block for
          connections.

     Usage:

          >>> import requests
          >>> s = requests.Session()
          >>> a = requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter(max_retries=3)
          >>> s.mount('http://', a)

      -- Method: add_headers (request, **kwargs)

          Add any headers needed by the connection.  As of v2.0 this
          does nothing by default, but is left for overriding by users
          that subclass the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.

          This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed
          for use when subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘request’ – The ‘PreparedRequest’ to add headers to.

             * ‘kwargs’ – The keyword arguments from the call to send().

      -- Method: build_connection_pool_key_attributes (request, verify,
               cert=None)

          Build the PoolKey attributes used by urllib3 to return a
          connection.

          This looks at the PreparedRequest, the user-specified verify
          value, and the value of the cert parameter to determine what
          PoolKey values to use to select a connection from a given
          urllib3 Connection Pool.

          The SSL related pool key arguments are not consistently set.
          As of this writing, use the following to determine what keys
          may be in that dictionary:

             * If ‘verify’ is ‘True’, ‘"ssl_context"’ will be set and
               will be the default Requests SSL Context

             * If ‘verify’ is ‘False’, ‘"ssl_context"’ will not be set
               but ‘"cert_reqs"’ will be set

             * If ‘verify’ is a string, (i.e., it is a user-specified
               trust bundle) ‘"ca_certs"’ will be set if the string is
               not a directory recognized by os.path.isdir(3), otherwise
               ‘"ca_cert_dir"’ will be set.

             * If ‘"cert"’ is specified, ‘"cert_file"’ will always be
               set.  If ‘"cert"’ is a tuple with a second item,
               ‘"key_file"’ will also be present

          To override these settings, one may subclass this class, call
          this method and use the above logic to change parameters as
          desired.  For example, if one wishes to use a custom
          ssl.SSLContext(4) one must both set ‘"ssl_context"’ and based
          on what else they require, alter the other keys to ensure the
          desired behaviour.


          Parameters:

             * ‘request’ (*note PreparedRequest: 37.) – The
               PreparedReqest being sent over the connection.

             * ‘verify’ – Either a boolean, in which case it controls
               whether we verify the server’s TLS certificate, or a
               string, in which case it must be a path to a CA bundle to
               use.

             * ‘cert’ – (optional) Any user-provided SSL certificate for
               client authentication (a.k.a., mTLS). This may be a
               string (i.e., just the path to a file which holds both
               certificate and key) or a tuple of length 2 with the
               certificate file path and key file path.


          Returns: A tuple of two dictionaries.  The first is the “host
          parameters” portion of the Pool Key including scheme,
          hostname, and port.  The second is a dictionary of SSLContext
          related parameters.

      -- Method: build_response (req, resp)

          Builds a *note Response: 11. object from a urllib3 response.
          This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed
          for use when subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘req’ – The ‘PreparedRequest’ used to generate the
               response.

             * ‘resp’ – The urllib3 response object.


          Return type: *note requests.Response: 11.

      -- Method: cert_verify (conn, url, verify, cert)

          Verify a SSL certificate.  This method should not be called
          from user code, and is only exposed for use when subclassing
          the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘conn’ – The urllib3 connection object associated with
               the cert.

             * ‘url’ – The requested URL.

             * ‘verify’ – Either a boolean, in which case it controls
               whether we verify the server’s TLS certificate, or a
               string, in which case it must be a path to a CA bundle to
               use

             * ‘cert’ – The SSL certificate to verify.

      -- Method: close ()

          Disposes of any internal state.

          Currently, this closes the PoolManager and any active
          ProxyManager, which closes any pooled connections.

      -- Method: get_connection (url, proxies=None)

          DEPRECATED: Users should move to
          ‘get_connection_with_tls_context’ for all subclasses of
          HTTPAdapter using Requests>=2.32.2.

          Returns a urllib3 connection for the given URL. This should
          not be called from user code, and is only exposed for use when
          subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘url’ – The URL to connect to.

             * ‘proxies’ – (optional) A Requests-style dictionary of
               proxies used on this request.


          Return type: urllib3.ConnectionPool

      -- Method: get_connection_with_tls_context (request, verify,
               proxies=None, cert=None)

          Returns a urllib3 connection for the given request and TLS
          settings.  This should not be called from user code, and is
          only exposed for use when subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter:
          69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘request’ – The ‘PreparedRequest’ object to be sent over
               the connection.

             * ‘verify’ – Either a boolean, in which case it controls
               whether we verify the server’s TLS certificate, or a
               string, in which case it must be a path to a CA bundle to
               use.

             * ‘proxies’ – (optional) The proxies dictionary to apply to
               the request.

             * ‘cert’ – (optional) Any user-provided SSL certificate to
               be used for client authentication (a.k.a., mTLS).


          Return type: urllib3.ConnectionPool

      -- Method: init_poolmanager (connections, maxsize, block=False,
               **pool_kwargs)

          Initializes a urllib3 PoolManager.

          This method should not be called from user code, and is only
          exposed for use when subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘connections’ – The number of urllib3 connection pools to
               cache.

             * ‘maxsize’ – The maximum number of connections to save in
               the pool.

             * ‘block’ – Block when no free connections are available.

             * ‘pool_kwargs’ – Extra keyword arguments used to
               initialize the Pool Manager.

      -- Method: proxy_headers (proxy)

          Returns a dictionary of the headers to add to any request sent
          through a proxy.  This works with urllib3 magic to ensure that
          they are correctly sent to the proxy, rather than in a
          tunnelled request if CONNECT is being used.

          This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed
          for use when subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters: ‘proxy’ – The url of the proxy being used for this
          request.


          Return type: dict(5)

      -- Method: proxy_manager_for (proxy, **proxy_kwargs)

          Return urllib3 ProxyManager for the given proxy.

          exposed for use when subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘proxy’ – The proxy to return a urllib3 ProxyManager for.

             * ‘proxy_kwargs’ – Extra keyword arguments used to
               configure the Proxy Manager.


          Returns: ProxyManager


          Return type: urllib3.ProxyManager(6)

      -- Method: request_url (request, proxies)

          Obtain the url to use when making the final request.

          If the message is being sent through a HTTP proxy, the full
          URL has to be used.  Otherwise, we should only use the path
          portion of the URL.

          This should not be called from user code, and is only exposed
          for use when subclassing the *note HTTPAdapter: 69.


          Parameters:

             * ‘request’ – The ‘PreparedRequest’ being sent.

             * ‘proxies’ – A dictionary of schemes or schemes and hosts
               to proxy URLs.

               cert=None, proxies=None)

          Sends PreparedRequest object.  Returns Response object.


          Parameters:

             * ‘request’ – The ‘PreparedRequest’ being sent.

             * ‘stream’ – (optional) Whether to stream the request
               content.

             * ‘timeout’ (float(8)‘ or ’tuple(9)‘ or ’‘urllib3 Timeout
               object’) – (optional) How long to wait for the server to
               send data before giving up, as a float, or a *note
               (connect timeout, read timeout): 73. tuple.

             * ‘verify’ – (optional) Either a boolean, in which case it
               controls whether we verify the server’s TLS certificate,
               or a string, in which case it must be a path to a CA
               bundle to use

             * ‘cert’ – (optional) Any user-provided SSL certificate to
               be trusted.

             * ‘proxies’ – (optional) The proxies dictionary to apply to
               the request.

4.1.8 Cookies
-------------

 -- Function: requests.utils.dict_from_cookiejar (cj)

     Returns a key/value dictionary from a CookieJar.


     Parameters: ‘cj’ – CookieJar object to extract cookies from.


     Return type: dict(1)

 -- Function: requests.utils.add_dict_to_cookiejar (cj, cookie_dict)

     Returns a CookieJar from a key/value dictionary.


     Parameters:

        * ‘cj’ – CookieJar to insert cookies into.

        * ‘cookie_dict’ – Dict of key/values to insert into CookieJar.


     Return type: CookieJar

 -- Function: requests.cookies.cookiejar_from_dict (cookie_dict,
          cookiejar=None, overwrite=True)

     Returns a CookieJar from a key/value dictionary.


     Parameters:

        * ‘cookie_dict’ – Dict of key/values to insert into CookieJar.

        * ‘cookiejar’ – (optional) A cookiejar to add the cookies to.

        * ‘overwrite’ – (optional) If False, will not replace cookies
          already in the jar with new ones.


     Return type: CookieJar

 -- Class: requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar (policy=None)

     Compatibility class; is a http.cookiejar.CookieJar, but exposes a
     dict interface.

     This is the CookieJar we create by default for requests and
     sessions that don’t specify one, since some clients may expect
     response.cookies and session.cookies to support dict operations.

     Requests does not use the dict interface internally; it’s just for
     compatibility with external client code.  All requests code should
     work out of the box with externally provided instances of
     ‘CookieJar’, e.g.  ‘LWPCookieJar’ and ‘FileCookieJar’.

     Unlike a regular CookieJar, this class is pickleable.

          Warning: dictionary operations that are normally O(1) may be
          O(n).

      -- Method: add_cookie_header (request)

          Add correct Cookie: header to request (urllib.request.Request
          object).

          The Cookie2 header is also added unless policy.hide_cookie2 is
          true.

      -- Method: clear (domain=None, path=None, name=None)

          Clear some cookies.

          Invoking this method without arguments will clear all cookies.
          If given a single argument, only cookies belonging to that
          domain will be removed.  If given two arguments, cookies
          belonging to the specified path within that domain are
          removed.  If given three arguments, then the cookie with the
          specified name, path and domain is removed.

          Raises KeyError if no matching cookie exists.

      -- Method: clear_expired_cookies ()

          Discard all expired cookies.

          You probably don’t need to call this method: expired cookies
          are never sent back to the server (provided you’re using
          DefaultCookiePolicy), this method is called by CookieJar
          itself every so often, and the .save() method won’t save
          expired cookies anyway (unless you ask otherwise by passing a
          true ignore_expires argument).

      -- Method: clear_session_cookies ()

          Discard all session cookies.

          Note that the .save() method won’t save session cookies
          anyway, unless you ask otherwise by passing a true
          ignore_discard argument.

      -- Method: copy ()

          Return a copy of this RequestsCookieJar.

      -- Method: extract_cookies (response, request)

          Extract cookies from response, where allowable given the
          request.

      -- Method: get (name, default=None, domain=None, path=None)

          Dict-like get() that also supports optional domain and path
          args in order to resolve naming collisions from using one
          cookie jar over multiple domains.

               Warning: operation is O(n), not O(1).

      -- Method: get_dict (domain=None, path=None)

          Takes as an argument an optional domain and path and returns a
          plain old Python dict of name-value pairs of cookies that meet
          the requirements.


          Return type: dict(2)

      -- Method: get_policy ()

          Return the CookiePolicy instance used.

      -- Method: items ()

          Dict-like items() that returns a list of name-value tuples
          from the jar.  Allows client-code to call
          ‘dict(RequestsCookieJar)’ and get a vanilla python dict of key
          value pairs.

          Return type: bool(3)

      -- Method: pop (k[, d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the
               corresponding value.

          If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise
          KeyError is raised.

      -- Method: popitem () -> (k, v), remove and return some (key,
               value) pair

          as a 2-tuple; but raise KeyError if D is empty.

      -- Method: set (name, value, **kwargs)

4.1.9 Status Code Lookup
------------------------

 -- Attribute: requests.codes

     alias of {}

The ‘codes’ object defines a mapping from common names for HTTP statuses
to their numerical codes, accessible either as attributes or as
dictionary items.

Example:

     >>> import requests
     >>> requests.codes['temporary_redirect']
     307
     >>> requests.codes.teapot
     418
     >>> requests.codes['\o/']
     200

Some codes have multiple names, and both upper- and lower-case versions
of the names are allowed.  For example, ‘codes.ok’, ‘codes.OK’, and
‘codes.okay’ all correspond to the HTTP status code 200.

meant to ease the pain of upgrading.

File: Requests.info,  Node: API Changes,  Next: Licensing,  Up: Migrating to 1 x

4.1.10.1 API Changes
....................

   * ‘Response.json’ is now a callable and not a property of a response.

          import requests
          r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
          r.json()   # This *call* raises an exception if JSON decoding fails

   * The ‘Session’ API has changed.  Sessions objects no longer take
     parameters.  ‘Session’ is also now capitalized, but it can still be
     instantiated with a lowercase ‘session’ for backwards
     compatibility.

          s = requests.Session()    # formerly, session took parameters
          s.auth = auth
          s.headers.update(headers)
          r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/headers')

   * All request hooks have been removed except ‘response’.

   * Authentication helpers have been broken out into separate modules.
     See requests-oauthlib(1) and requests-kerberos(2).

   * The parameter for streaming requests was changed from ‘prefetch’ to
     ‘stream’ and the logic was inverted.  In addition, ‘stream’ is now
     required for raw response reading.

          # in 0.x, passing prefetch=False would accomplish the same thing
          r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events', stream=True)
          for chunk in r.iter_content(8192):
              ...

   * The ‘config’ parameter to the requests method has been removed.
     Some of these options are now configured on a ‘Session’ such as
     keep-alive and maximum number of redirects.  The verbosity option
     should be handled by configuring logging.

          import requests
          import logging

          # Enabling debugging at http.client level (requests->urllib3->http.client)
          # you will see the REQUEST, including HEADERS and DATA, and RESPONSE with HEADERS but without DATA.
          # the only thing missing will be the response.body which is not logged.
          try: # for Python 3
              from http.client import HTTPConnection
          except ImportError:
              from httplib import HTTPConnection
          HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1

          logging.basicConfig() # you need to initialize logging, otherwise you will not see anything from requests
          logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
          requests_log = logging.getLogger("urllib3")
          requests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
          requests_log.propagate = True

          requests.get('https://httpbin.org/headers')

4.1.10.2 Licensing
..................

One key difference that has nothing to do with the API is a change in
the license from the ISC(1) license to the Apache 2.0(2) license.  The
Apache 2.0 license ensures that contributions to Requests are also
covered by the Apache 2.0 license.

4.1.11 Migrating to 2.x
-----------------------

Compared with the 1.0 release, there were relatively few backwards
incompatible changes, but there are still a few issues to be aware of
with this major release.

For more details on the changes in this release including new APIs,
links to the relevant GitHub issues and some of the bug fixes, read
Cory’s blog(1) on the subject.

File: Requests.info,  Node: API Changes<2>,  Next: Behavioural Changes,  Up: Migrating to 2 x

4.1.11.1 API Changes
....................

   * There were a couple changes to how Requests handles exceptions.
     ‘RequestException’ is now a subclass of ‘IOError’ rather than
     ‘RuntimeError’ as that more accurately categorizes the type of
     error.  In addition, an invalid URL escape sequence now raises a
     subclass of ‘RequestException’ rather than a ‘ValueError’.

          requests.get('http://%zz/')   # raises requests.exceptions.InvalidURL

     Lastly, ‘httplib.IncompleteRead’ exceptions caused by incorrect
     chunked encoding will now raise a Requests ‘ChunkedEncodingError’
     instead.

   * The proxy API has changed slightly.  The scheme for a proxy URL is
     now required.

          proxies = {
            "http": "10.10.1.10:3128",    # use http://10.10.1.10:3128 instead
          }

          # In requests 1.x, this was legal, in requests 2.x,
          #  this raises requests.exceptions.MissingSchema
          requests.get("http://example.org", proxies=proxies)


File: Requests.info,  Node: Behavioural Changes,  Prev: API Changes<2>,  Up: Migrating to 2 x

4.1.11.2 Behavioural Changes
............................

   * Keys in the ‘headers’ dictionary are now native strings on all
     Python versions, i.e.  bytestrings on Python 2 and unicode on
     Python 3.  If the keys are not native strings (unicode on Python 2
     or bytestrings on Python 3) they will be converted to the native
     string type assuming UTF-8 encoding.

   * Values in the ‘headers’ dictionary should always be strings.  This
     has been the project’s position since before 1.0 but a recent
     change (since version 2.11.0) enforces this more strictly.  It’s
     advised to avoid passing header values as unicode when possible.

5.1 Contributor’s Guide
=======================

If you’re reading this, you’re probably interested in contributing to
Requests.  Thank you very much!  Open source projects live-and-die based
on the support they receive from others, and the fact that you’re even
considering contributing to the Requests project is 'very' generous of
you.

This document lays out guidelines and advice for contributing to this
project.  If you’re thinking of contributing, please start by reading
this document and getting a feel for how contributing to this project
works.  If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to either Nate
Prewitt(1), Ian Cordasco(2), or Seth Michael Larson(3), the primary
maintainers.

The guide is split into sections based on the type of contribution
you’re thinking of making, with a section that covers general guidelines
for all contributors.

5.1.1 Code of Conduct
---------------------

The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a
diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.  It is through
these differences that our community experiences great successes and
continued growth.  When you’re working with members of the community,
follow the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct(1) to help steer
your interactions and keep Python a positive, successful, and growing
community.

5.1.2 Get Early Feedback
------------------------

If you are contributing, do not feel the need to sit on your
contribution until it is perfectly polished and complete.  It helps
everyone involved for you to seek feedback as early as you possibly can.
Submitting an early, unfinished version of your contribution for
feedback in no way prejudices your chances of getting that contribution
accepted, and can save you from putting a lot of work into a
contribution that is not suitable for the project.

5.1.3 Contribution Suitability
------------------------------

Our project maintainers have the last word on whether or not a
contribution is suitable for Requests.  All contributions will be
considered carefully, but from time to time, contributions will be
rejected because they do not suit the current goals or needs of the
project.

If your contribution is rejected, don’t despair!  As long as you
followed these guidelines, you will have a much better chance of getting
your next contribution accepted.

5.1.4.1 Steps for Submitting Code
.................................

When contributing code, you’ll want to follow this checklist:

  1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

  2. Run the tests to confirm they all pass on your system.  If they
     don’t, you’ll need to investigate why they fail.  If you’re unable
     to diagnose this yourself, raise it as a bug report by following
     the guidelines in this document: *note Bug Reports: 1e5.

  3. Write tests that demonstrate your bug or feature.  Ensure that they
     fail.

  4. Make your change.

  5. Run the entire test suite again, confirming that all tests pass
     'including the ones you just added'.

  6. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository’s ‘main’ branch.
     GitHub Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration
     on this project.

The following sub-sections go into more detail on some of the points
above.

5.1.4.2 Code Review
...................

Contributions will not be merged until they’ve been code reviewed.  You
should implement any code review feedback unless you strongly object to
it.  In the event that you object to the code review feedback, you
should make your case clearly and calmly.  If, after doing so, the
feedback is judged to still apply, you must either apply the feedback or
withdraw your contribution.

5.1.4.3 Code Style
..................

Requests uses a collection of tools to ensure the code base has a
consistent style as it grows.  We have these orchestrated using a tool
called pre-commit(1).  This can be installed locally and run over your
changes prior to opening a PR, and will also be run as part of the CI
approval process before a change is merged.

You can find the full list of formatting requirements specified in the
.pre-commit-config.yaml(2) at the top level directory of Requests.

5.1.4.4 New Contributors
........................

If you are new or relatively new to Open Source, welcome!  Requests aims
to be a gentle introduction to the world of Open Source.  If you’re
concerned about how best to contribute, please consider mailing a
maintainer (listed above) and asking for help.

Please also check the *note Get Early Feedback: 1e0. section.

5.1.5 Documentation Contributions
---------------------------------

Documentation improvements are always welcome!  The documentation files
live in the ‘docs/’ directory of the codebase.  They’re written in
reStructuredText(1), and use Sphinx(2) to generate the full suite of
documentation.

When contributing documentation, please do your best to follow the style
of the documentation files.  This means a soft-limit of 79 characters
wide in your text files and a semi-formal, yet friendly and
approachable, prose style.

When presenting Python code, use single-quoted strings (‘'hello'’
instead of ‘"hello"’).

5.1.6 Bug Reports
-----------------

Bug reports are hugely important!  Before you raise one, though, please
check through the GitHub issues(1), 'both open and closed', to confirm
that the bug hasn’t been reported before.  Duplicate bug reports are a
huge drain on the time of other contributors, and should be avoided as
much as possible.

5.1.7 Feature Requests
----------------------

Requests is in a perpetual feature freeze, only the BDFL can add or
approve of new features.  The maintainers believe that Requests is a
feature-complete piece of software at this time.

One of the most important skills to have while maintaining a
largely-used open source project is learning the ability to say “no” to
suggested changes, while keeping an open ear and mind.

If you believe there is a feature missing, feel free to raise a feature
request, but please do be aware that the overwhelming likelihood is that
your feature request will not be accepted.
